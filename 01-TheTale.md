#Chapter One - The Tale and the Telling. 

When I first saw Boltac, I was a masterless boy running riot through the kingdom of my own life. My mother, perhaps, had died in childbirth. My father, perhaps, had been killed in a war, or drowned in a well or run off. Perhaps they had been changed into deer or made to vanish in a puff of smoke. Those were the far different days, when more thing were possible and many more things were actual. 
Yes, I speak of magic, in all it's wonder and horror. I remember a time when it was real. And, if we speak the truth here by the fire, magic was far more terrible than the stories would have you believe. It came at such a price, and that price was not paid by the powerful, but by the small, the ordinary and the orphaned. 

I cannot say that all magic is gone from the world. Perhaps it is a like the fires of summer. Years can pass without a whiff of smoke. Then, for no reason known to us, the world burns. Mayhap the fires are necessary, part of some larger cycle beyond our ken. But for the small, the ordinary, the little people who enjoy loud stories on a quiet evening, the world is a better place without fire, without magic. 

But enough philosophy, and on with the tale. Pointless musings are the entertainments of an old men, just as deed are the strength of young men. 

Boltac found me stealing goods in the market. Ccaught is a better word. As he haggled with a man selling fabric from one of the Southern Kingdoms, I was stealing food from anywhere I could. I was perhaps, six at the time -- I do not know the date of my birth -- and as all six year olds, somewhat lacking in discipline. But then, in the time of magic, there was more hunger in the world. 

Hunger has a magic all it's own you know. Go even one day without eating and your sense of smell becomes so acute, your sense of hearing so attuned, that fat sizzling on charcoal can cause physical pain. Though nothing outward touch your body, the magic of hunger works it's changes. The mouth fills with juice, the eyes grow wide and the will grows weak.  

I knew it was a bad pull from the start. I could see a clear line to the slices of meat over the fire. I could see my entry and my exit. But that meant that everyone else could too. 

With more planning, you see. With better organization. A pack of children running through the market -- laughing and taunting each other -- would be normal. But one, rail-thin, deadly serious child, feet sped by the magic of hunger. Well, how could anyone not see that coming?

The food vendor, and vile-tempered man who I remember now with a heavy brow and a broken nose, did not try to stop me.  He watched me run all the way in. He waited for me to sear my hand upon a piece of delicious meat. He let me turn, start my escape. I even think, he waited until I believed myself home free. Until I could almost taste of that piece of cow or rabbit or rat and feel it's warmth and substance filling the empty hole that was my stomach. 

Then, he tripped me. 



To youth, patience is a foreign language.  


It was a bad pull from the start. 


"Prentice!" a voice boomed. "Why are you lazing about on the ground" I expected to see a much bigger man, but when I swiveled my head around, I saw a barrel-chested man limping towards my predictament.

Those were fat days in Robrecht, I can tell you that. Of the city and her politics, her ways are more twisted than the blackened pathways fo

Rattick tells him -- you have something of the thief about you -- mostly the eyes. Come with me and 'prentice' to a master thief

But there is something of the thief and the coward and the hero that dances in the eyes of all men. What we choose to practice makes the difference.  







"He's a bad man," the Chamberlain told, Boltac, "and no good will come of him." 

"No good will come of trifling with him," said Boltac, and made a motion as if he was to spit. 

We all knew he was a man with a past. What none of us realized was he was a man with a future. I had the nerve to ask him to borrow a sword. He hit me on the head

then he gave me the sword. He was like that. 

Endless hours

Let me slow down and tell you something of the place that I live. 


Now I am first Knight of Boltac, granted the landholdings of the North. The most dangerous-- I am accounted a brave man by many deeds and more tales, but I will tell you. In all my days, I have never seen anything more brave than a fat shopkeeper with a limp, setting out to rescue the woman he loved.
