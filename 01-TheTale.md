It's a Western in which the cowboys aren't worth a damn and the general store owner saves the day.

But the general store owner is Zero Mostel. Peter Lorre.

The Wizard is... English gentleman Alston Wheezemont. Never wanted for money, never will.

#Chapter One - The Tale and the Telling. 


There are things that are true. There are things that we want to be true. These things are almost never the same. I think that any man who says he has fully learned this lesson is a liar. I know I haven't. But I remember the first time I applied myself to this lesson -- or rather, the first time this lesson was applied to me.  


I had pushed my luck too far. 

When I first saw Boltac, I was a masterless boy running riot through the kingdom of my own life. My mother, perhaps, had died in childbirth. My father, perhaps, had been killed in a war, or drowned in a well or run off. Perhaps they had been changed into deer or made to vanish in a puff of smoke. Those were the far different days, when more thing were possible and many more things were actual. 
Yes, I speak of magic, in all it's wonder and horror. I remember a time when it was real. And, if we speak the truth here by the fire, magic was far more terrible than the stories would have you believe. It came at such a price, and that price was not paid by the powerful, but by the small, the ordinary and the orphaned. 

I cannot say that all magic is gone from the world. Perhaps it is a like the fires of summer. Years can pass without a whiff of smoke. Then, for no reason known to us, the world burns. Mayhap the fires are necessary, part of some larger cycle beyond our ken. But for the small, the ordinary, the little people who enjoy loud stories on a quiet evening, the world is a better place without fire, without magic. 

But enough philosophy, and on with the tale. Pointless musings are the entertainments of an old men, just as deed are the strength of young men. 

Boltac found me stealing goods in the market. Caught is a better word. As he haggled with a man selling fabric from one of the Southern Kingdoms, I was stealing food from anywhere I could. I was perhaps, eight at the time -- I do not know the date of my birth -- and as all eight year-olds, somewhat lacking in discipline. But then, in that time of magic, there was more hunger in the world. 

Hunger has a magic all it's own you know. Go even one day without eating and your sense of smell becomes so acute, your sense of hearing so attuned, that fat sizzling on charcoal can cause physical pain. Though nothing outward touch your body, the magic of hunger works it's changes. The mouth fills with juice, the eyes grow wide and the will grows weak.  

I knew it was a bad pull from the start. I could see a clear line to the slices of meat over the fire. I could see my entry and my exit. But that meant that everyone else could too. 

With more planning, you see. With better organization. A pack of children running through the market -- laughing and taunting each other -- would be normal. But one, rail-thin, deadly serious child, feet sped by the magic of hunger. Well, how could anyone not see that coming?

The food vendor, and vile-tempered man who I remember now with a heavy brow and a broken nose, did not try to stop me.  He watched me run all the way in. He waited for me to sear my hand upon a piece of delicious meat. He let me turn, start my escape. I even think, he waited until I believed myself home free. Until I could almost taste that piece of cow or rabbit or rat or whatever it was. 

Then, he tripped me. 

I hit the dirty stones of the marketplace hard. The greasy meat slid out of my hand and off into the crowd. I struggled to regain my breathe, but before I could scramble to my feet, the vendor's foot was in my stomach. "Steal from me, will you?"

I do not know what he would have done to me. The old days were more magical, but less kind. Any of the old stories will show you that. Those who weren't prepared or quick or clever often met with horrible fates. Good children of loving families were always getting eaten by wolves, trapped by witches or stolen by Faeries (oh yes, they were real) So who would shed a tear at disappearance of another orphan?  

My fearsome imaginings were interrupted by another voice, unknown to me. "Oh Alvasir, you fierce man you! Now what are you going to do with the starving boy now that you've caught him?"

"I should murder the little theiveling," said the man standing on my chest. He didn't sound like he was joking, but the other man laughed anyway. 

"You? Murder! Why think of the scandal!"

"What scandal? Who would miss this bastard boy."

"Who's talking about the boy, ya yutz? Whattya gonna do to get rid of the body?"

"The river Swift keeps all secrets," he said ominously.

"Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute," the voice said, in a hurry that bespoke confusions. "For the price of a piece of, we'll generously call it beef, you're going to wrench that boy's neck -- "

"Stomp his guts out,"

"Sweaty work, either way. Then while haul him up the hill to the canyon and throw him down into the river, right in the middle of the day, in the middle of town, in front of everyone?"

"Well, I would wait until dark."

"Oh, until dark. I see, that's very thoughtful, you're inner criminal mastermind is certainly coming into it's own. And what do you think that is going to do for sales of your, uh, sausage-product?"

"It will damn sure cut down on losses. Word will get out, Rumpustle Alvasir is not a man to be trifled with," said sinking more of his weight into me as he stood up straight and proud.

"Rumpustle. Rum-pustle," said the voice as if he was rolling the name around in his mouth to see how it tasted.

"What's wrong with Rumpustle?"

"With the name, nothing. With you... eeeeeh. Look, 'Pustle. Can I call you 'Pustle? Think it through. See it with me now." With this a belly surmounted by a triple-chin came into view. The man who belonged to that unusual voice, put his arm around the man who wanted to kill me. The foot came out of my stomach a little. 

"You are a sausage man. A sausage Monger. A vendor of food for hungry market-goers? I am right?"

"Yes, but..."

"But? There is no but. You sell sausage! It's a noble calling. But, if you stomp this poor, unfortunate child's guts out, business will suffer."

"Business?"

"Whattya got, like four, five more hours of daylight. That means his rotting corpse is gonna lie here in hot sun for hours. And anyone who wants to buy a sausage is going to have to track through his intestines to get lunch. And, y'know who wants to do that? Nobody. Stomp this kid flat and ya sales are gonna take a hit. And then, at the end of a long, profitless day, you still have to carry his body up the hill, and vffffp, into the river. That is, if the city watch don't get you first."

While this was going on, I was wiggling, ever so slightly, out from under 'Pustle's foot. I had hope that I might yet make an escape. {He put such weight into my stomach,}

"The city watch and I have an arrangement," 'Pustle said proudly. 

"You give them your sausages? It's a wonder they haven't arrested you already."

"What do you mean?" said the man, sounding hurt. I squirmed a little more.

"Any way you slice it, it's just not worth it. So let the boy go."

"I will have my satisfaction!" said 'Pustle, the fury returning to his voice and his weight returning to my spleen. "That's worth more than money."

"Really? More than money?" said a skeptical Boltac. 

"No, no. You fat cripple, do not try your negotiation magic on me. The boy has stolen from me. At the very least, I will give him a good beating for my troubles."

"Ah, so there is room to negotiate!" said Boltac.

"No, I just told you, I will not negotiate!"

"Yes, but you just changed your position. A minute ago, you said, 'I'm going to stomp the life out of this boy,' but now, you've dropped down to a more reasonable beating."

"Excuse me?" I said. 

"Shut up," said Boltac, "You should never negotiate for yourself. Remember that, it's  rule number one."








"Rule number one. Don't steal. Rule number two, if you are going to steal, make sure you grab something that's worth something."

I was confused about rule number one. I had known the man less than five minutes and already there were two rule number ones. I decided to see if that sorted itself out and instead said, "But I was hungry."

"Well, you very nearly solved that problem, didn't you. Dead men tell no tales. And they eat no sandwiches."







"Never sell yourself. And MOST of all, never sell yaself short."

Sequel -- You know, you remind me of me. And that's why I don't like you. 

What?

That's exactly what I would say. You want me to enforce your Writ of Sale so that no one else can have store in Robrecht. And you'd probably like me to to charge some kind of license fee for those wanted stalls in the market?

"Well, in your wisdom, you have said it my King, we must protect buyers from..." his words trailed off under Boltac's withering stare, "so that all will know that Robrecht is a safe and a fair... place to... do? business?"

"Enh-henh," said Boltac, "That won't protect buyers from the likes of you. All that will do is protect the likes of you from other sellers. The same rapacious wolves who are the only thing that can keep rapacious wolves like you at bay."

"Such disloyalty to the Merchant's Guild. I will report this. "

But I risked my life for this

And for that I am sorry, but the market says, it wasn't worth it.

But how is an honest adventurer supposed to make a living?

"An honest living? Is that what you want?" asked Boltac so sweetly, that I knew an explosion couldn't be far off.

"That's all any man asks. Especially as recompense for such selfless acts of heroism as keep this kingdom safe."

"Duchy," said Boltac.

"Nah, no matter who they are, they're all after my profits."

"You do not sound loyal to your King."

"Duke," said Boltac, "It's a Duchy. So it comes with a Duke. Perhaps I can get the boy here to hold up diagrams as we go along. And I'm not particular fond of the Duke, or any of the others. The man in charge around here changes so often it makes your head spin. But you know what never changes? The tax man."

RATTICK

"But someone else risked their life for this."

You should be glad to see me. Glad of my custom in your store. Why I am one of your best customers. Without me you would have nothing to sell. 

Without you, Rattick, I feel that more people would be alive for me to sell things to.

"Don't be so hasty with your accusations. I am just a guide. I try to warn my charges, to provide good counsel for those who are adventure-minded, but, as we both know," Rattick said with something that sounded like sadness, "the world is a dangerous place."

"What a comfort that must be to their families," said Boltac. "That's my final offer."

"Some day Boltac, you are going to be in a position of weakness."

"If it evah happens, I can promise you, sweetheart, I won't be negotiating. Thank you. COME AGAIN!"




----

Wait, orphan. You aren't any kind of a chosen one? You don't have any mystical destiny I should know about? Are you spoken of in prophecy? 

"I don't think so. I don't think children who sleep in a pile of sticks against the lower wall are spoken of in prophecy"

You didn't float here in a bassinet made of reeds did you?

What's a bassinet. 

"Ah, yes. That's just what I like to hear. A bassinet is a special kind of basket in which you abandon babies."

"I wasn't abandoned as a baby. My parents were killed when I was five."

[[ Boltac tries the chosen one gambit -- tries to fake out the Wizard with the the boy -- of course, he is just a boy.]]

Oh my Lady, welcome to Boltac's

"It's a secret of the trade, treat the serving girl's like ladies and the ladies like serving girls. They LOVE that!"

I know a man in Brythria, has the finest daggers money can buy. 



---

Marriage proposal. 

Boltac, I have debts. 

Now she tells me! You mean you don't have a dowry. No wait. Wait!" even though Asarah wasn't trying to say anything, "Its worse than that. You come with a negative dowry!"

---

"Prentice!" a voice boomed. "Why are you lazing about on the ground!" I struggled to see the source of the large voice, but could not escape the foot in my stomach. "I asked you a question!" the voice demanded. 

"I tripped," I said, barely able to get enough breath in my lungs to speak. 

"Alvasir, remove your foot from my boy, so he can tell me what he has done with my supper."

"Lunch?" asked the man with his foot in stomach. "You mean to tell me this sneak-thief is your apprentice?"

"Why of course he is. And a good boy too. Have you ever seen delivery boy so quick? I tell him to run and fetch my supper and you see how fast he moves."

"A thief, says I. A starveling not smart enough to run in a pack."

A pair of expensive boots, trimmed with fur, came into my limited view. "'Prentice, says I. Now move your foot." After moment, the pressure in my stomach eased. I sucked in air and rolled over clutching my side. 

When I looked, I was surprised to see that the owner of the voice was short, much shorter than it's booming register led me to believe.Boltac had the voice of a hero, but was squat and broad-chested. Perhaps 5'6". Alvasir, purveyor of unknown meat, glared down upon him. "He hasn't paid," he said, without outstretched palm.

Boltac grabbed my arm and lifted me to my feet. As soon as I was off the ground, my better instincts took over and I tried to wriggle free. But his grip was like a vise and I was held fast. 

"Prentice, pay the man," he said, pressing a coin into my hand. 

I looked down and saw a piece of gold, GOLD! In my palm. Gold was something that I had heard of, that I had heard clinking together in the depths of fat purses, that I had caught glimpse of like the flashes of fish in dark streams, but to actually hold a piece of it in my hand. This was more than enough to pay for the meat I had attempted to steal, and perhaps enough to pay for the man's whole food stand.

To this day, I don't know why I did what I did. Perhaps it was because I had never had much of anything before. Well, nothing except rags, a pain in my stomach and a nearly constant search for a place to sleep. But this was a gold coin. This was everything. 

"How much?" I asked.

"Give me the coin boy!" 

Having nothing to lose, I said, "A coin of gold for your fried rat?" The crowd of onlookers laughed. "Your price is too dear for me. My master would beat me for paying so much." 

"THIEF!" exploded Alvasir, "Give me the gold!" 

"As you see, I train my 'prentices well." He flung a few pennies on the ground and said, "Sorry for the trouble Alvasir." And he turned around and walked away. 

As soon as the crowd closed behind us, I tried to twist out of his grasp. I could remember nothing good ever happening to me, so why should I recognize a lucky break when it came my way? Boltac said nothing. He just left his vice like left hand clamped on my arm and made his way up the hill with his odd, limping gait. 

Exhausted, I asked, "Why did you save me?"

"I did not save you, boy. I made a purchase. I have need of a 'Prentice, and you seem a likely lad," he said with a laugh.  

"So I am an your slave." I asked, more than a little afraid. 

Boltac stopped. "Do you still have the gold coin lad?"

I nodded.

"Then let us make a deal," he said as he released my arm. "There. You are a free man, er, boy. Of some means. You may go." When I didn't run off, Boltac said, "There. Hungry, dirty you may be, but you're sure not stupid. Show that coin in the gutters lad and you'll lose it and your life in the blink of an eye. Come with me, work hard, and I will teach you a trade. Bastard boy will become a man, dealing equally with all and beholden to none."

I looked back down the hill. Thinking of the place below the market where I had been sleeping. It was little more than a pile of sticks and damp rags. And though I thought myself lord and master of my own hovel, the rats had other thoughts on the matter.

"Or, take the coin as gift of fate, and good luck to you, you prince of the streets."

It was no choice at all. I shook my head and offered the coin. 

"Enh," said Boltac as he took the coin. "That will do. What's your name, boy?"

"Relan."

"Ugh, what an awful name," he said, then turned and climbed the hill with his crab-wise, clumping right foot. Even though he was lamed I had trouble keeping up with him.

Those were fat days for the city of Robrecht.

Have to reveal his mangled leg. Like the man with the fucked up face.

Those were fat days in Robrecht, I can tell you that. Of the city and her politics, her ways are more twisted than the blackened pathways fo

Rattick tells him -- you have something of the thief about you -- mostly the eyes. Come with me and 'prentice' to a master thief

But there is something of the thief and the coward and the hero that dances in the eyes of all men. What we choose to practice makes the difference.  







"He's a bad man," the Chamberlain told, Boltac, "and no good will come of him." 

"No good will come of trifling with him," said Boltac, and made a motion as if he was to spit. 

We all knew he was a man with a past. What none of us realized was he was a man with a future. I had the nerve to ask him to borrow a sword. He hit me on the head

then he gave me the sword. He was like that. 

Endless hours

Let me slow down and tell you something of the place that I live. 


Now I am first Knight of Boltac, granted the landholdings of the North. The most dangerous-- I am accounted a brave man by many deeds and more tales, but I will tell you. In all my days, I have never seen anything more brave than a fat shopkeeper with a limp, setting out to rescue the woman he loved.
