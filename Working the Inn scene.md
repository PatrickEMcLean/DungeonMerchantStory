"Asarah, my love!" Boltac bellowed before the door had even had a chance to close behind him, "I have come to rescue from all of this."

The hurried, hard-working, yet beautiful mistress of the Inn, turned away from a table she was clearing. When she saw who it was, the professional smile fell from her face and she said, "And who's going to rescue you?"

Boltac climbed up on a bar stool, and said, "No, no. I mean it this time. I have come to sweep you away from all this pointless drudgery. We shall journey to a far kingdom where I am Lord and Master and you will be my Queen."

Asarah threw her thick, black mane of hair back from her face with one free hand. She walked behind the bar, set her hands on the well-worn wooden top and asked, "Whattya want Boltac."

"Only you my love."

"Yeah, well, all you got is money. I ain't for sale. Now what are you having?"

"Asarah, can I borrow an ale?"

"What? Borrow an ale?"

"I know, right?"



"I hate to think what condition you'll give it back to me." She quipped and was pleased to see that he smiled back.

"I promise, it will be liquid. But seriously, can I borrow an ale?"

"What? No. Who asks such a thing?"

"Exactly!" said Boltac, pounding his fist on the bar. "Who asks such a thing? But people do. I swear to heaven they do. A young man, not 20 minutes ago, walked into my store and had the nerve to ask me if he could borrow a sword."

"What? You mean like you'd ask a neighbor to borrow a cup of sugar."

"Yes, exactly. Except when you borrow a cup of sugar, you don't go off and use it to get yourself killed trying to save some damn fool... Priestess of Dar. 

"Oh, virgin love," she said with a look in her eye that made Boltac realize that shattering her illusions about the Priestess of Dar would be the wrong thing to do. 

"Hmmm," he said into his beer. 

"So, did you loan him the sword?"

"No," snapped Boltac, foam flying from his lips. "I hit him over the head with a club, dragged him across the street and left him unconscious on the bench out front."

Now her eyes flashed dark against the wave of her hair. "How *could* you?" 

"It was easy, actually, I just took my... Look, woman. When you pick up a sword you pick up a lot of other things with it. And if the lad wasn't ready to deal with the ambush of a shopkeeper with a bad leg, then he certainly wasn't ready to deal with whatever dangerous and vile thing he meant to bash in the head to preserve the honor of his wench."

"That word again, Wench, you said she was a priestess."

"Same difference."

"It's not and you know it," said Asarah. "Don't you see? How romantic it is?"

"I see how stupid it is."

"No," said Asarah, growing upset. "That's how she will know. The only way she can know!"

"Know what, that he's an idiot."

"The girl, she's in danger right?"

"I think it was something more along the lines of a fight for her honor, but sure, let's say she's in danger."

"Danger. She's been kidnapped, let's say. And she's being held captive at the bottom of horrible dungeon."

"Certainly are plenty of horrible dungeons around Robrecht," said Boltac, looking around the room as if he wished the subject would change itself. 

"Oh, it's so romantic. And he goes to rescue her and when he *does* rescue her that's how she *knows*."

"Knows what?"

"That he loves her. That he really, truly loves her above all others."

"That's how she'll know he's a muscle-headed idiot who's good with a sword."

"But he can't because some fat, greedy merchant wouldn't loan him a sword."

"No," said Boltac, pushing his anger back down, "I could loan him a sword and armor and everything else in my store. He can't because he DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO USE A SWORD!"

"Keep your voice down," hissed Asarah. You're disturbing the other patrons!"

"Patron," quipped Boltac across his empty tankard. 

Asarah slammed a full ale down in front of him and said. "There's no romance in your life. No passion. I feel sorry for you Boltac." And then she stormed off into the back. 

"Safer that way," Boltac muttered into the foam of his first sip. 




And then, her tough exterior melted.

The door opened behind Boltac and a cool wind filled the inn. It crawled over his collar, and danced down his spine with icy fingers. Boltac turned to see who it was. 

Dimsbury.
