# Chapter One: the Chosen Two 

"I'm the chosen one. Only I can bring peace and restore balance to the land," said the blonde Knight in Shiningâ„¢ Armor.

"You still don't understand," said the Ranger, clad-in-mail. He hiked up his sleeve and showed a mark that was burned into his arm. "This symbol of the Cruel God Azaz, signifies,"

"Azaz my Az-ass! that your whore of a mother spilled bacon fat on you when you were a child. "

The two men drew swords and leapt to either side of the trail. But before either of them had a chance to swing, a thin man, dressed in faded black, stepped between them. Rattick said,  "Please my Lords, please, we mustn't fight among ourselves."

"Out of my way servant!" cried the Ranger, "It is my destiny to run him through."

"You don't have a destiny. I am the CHOSEN ONE!" shrieked the Knight.

"Perhaps," said Rattick, "You have both chosen." They stopped, swords frozen in space, to consider this possibility. "We go to face a mighty foe. A powerful wizard in a deep dungeon. Perhaps all the others have failed not because they didn't have a chosen one, but because they didn't have enough chosen ones."

"I AM THE CHOSEN ONE!" they both shouted.

Okay, thought Rattick, that was a mistake. Best to let the idiots fight it out. But before he could step off the field of idiocy so the battle could commence, the Enchantress chimed in, "Don't talk to him like that," she, "He is a member of this party. Moreover, the sacred vows I have taken at the Shrine of Lauranda, means that I must treat all beings with courtesy and respect. All things with respect, and eat nothing with a face," she intoned with an air of reverence.

Surprisingly, it worked. The men lowered their swords and apologized (apologized!) to each other. Rattick stared longingly at the Enchantress and the belt of gold rings that encircled her hips through the robe of white she wore. She was beautiful, perhaps there was a way... No. Better not to think of it. 

"Forgive me good Rattick," said the Knight, his head bowed slightly, "Though it is true that we have paid you to guide us to the lair of foul Oddna the Wizard, you have served us true and are a member of this party."

"We brave companions," said the Ranger, "we happy few, each, in our own way, fulfilling a mystical and wondrous destiny. Yes, we are all sorry to have used you so badly faithful Rattick."

Rattick stood there with his mouth hanging open. Could they be serious? Were they conning him rather than the other way around? With an effort of will, he snapped his mouth shut and pasted a smile across it. 

"Not at all, good sirs," said Rattick. "We are adventurers! Spirits run high with ones so bold as we." 

"Huzzah!" cried the Knight, as he lifted his heavy blade in the air. 

"Huzzah," cried the Ranger, clanging his blade against the man he was very recently going to fight to the death. 

"Huzzah," giggled the Enchantress, clapping her hands together and sending a tiny fireball up to dance against the blades.

"Christ Almighty," thought Rattick as he lifted his dagger in half-hearted salute.
 
                       *  *  *

"This is it," said Rattick.

"What do you mean?" said the Ranger, "You mean this? It's just a door in the side of a hill."

"You expected a sign?" asked Rattick. 

"Well, I... I don't know what I expected."

"Yes, that's why you hired me to guide you here."

"No good fellow," protested the Ranger, "Don't wound me like that. You are not hireling, but companion, member of our brave band."

"Yeah, yeah," said Rattick, "Let's get to it." He reached of the handle of the door, but before he could reach it the Enchantress interrupted. 

"A supplication. We must seek the supplication of Lauranda. Her blessing will keep us save during our time of trial." The Knight and the Ranger both drew their swords and knelt. Rattick rolled his eyes. Just get it over with. He didn't know how much more amateur hour he could take. But he consoled himself with the knowledge that it would all be over soon. 

                                    * * *

Rattick smiled when he heard the rumblings and gnashing of teeth from the darkness ahead of them. The Troll was still there and he sounded hungry. "Stay here, faithful companions," he said, playing it for all it is worth, "I will use my mastery of stealth and shadow to scout the way."

He handed his torch to the Ranger and disappeared into the darkness. As soon as he rounded the corner he stopped and squatted down in the passageway. Scout ahead. Faithful companions. What nonsense. Rattick wasn't sticking his neck out any farther than he had to. He waited a suitable amount of time. 

He returned the pool of torchlight. He donned an expression of fear and, with a skill long practiced, managed to tremble as he spoke. "It is a *Troll* my companions. A creature most large and fearsome. I fear it is more than we can defeat. We should turn back."

"Ha ha ha ha!" laughed the Knight, falling for it. "A Troll! That is nothing to a Knight of the Yarven Dawn."

"And it is even less to the blessed and Chosen of Azaz," said the Ranger, reaching for his sleeve. 

Rattick felt like he was going to throw up when he said, "You are so much braver and stronger than I?"

As he drew his sword, the Knight said, "Stay behind me and learn how it is done. Fear not Rattick, for you are in the company of heroes."

"I shall not let you steal the glory!" cried the Ranger as he shouldered the Knight aside. 

Rattick couldn't believe it. The idiots charged. A frontal assault on a Troll? They were so stupid he wondered how they had remembered to breathe on the trek in. 

The Enchantress edged passed him, smelling of exotic perfume. "I will see if I can bind the creature with The Mother's Embrace. Stay behind me and you will be safe."

They advanced through the corridor. There was a roar and the stench of something awful. Rattick new this to be Troll's breath. Nothing smells worse than rotting flesh trapped between teeth.

When she saw the troll the Enchantress raised her hands to cast a spell. As her hands began to weave an intricate the pattern,  Rattick slid his knife across her perfect, alabaster white throat. She gasped in horror as her life's blood ran down her neck and over the exquisite Ruby necklace she wore. Before she could make another sound, Rattick caught her gently and dragged her back into the darkness, away from the sounds of a Troll at play and two men at hazard. 

She looked up at Rattick and mouthed,  "Why?" Rattick tore necklace from her throat. Then he wiped the blood from it with a black silk handkerchief. In the distance, the screams of onto of the chosen one's ended in a terrible, squishy, bone-crunching noise.

"Why? Because it was a kindness? Because there are worse things in the depths of this dungeon than you can imagine? Because you chose to play a dangerous game? All of those are close enough, but if you really want the truth..."

He looked down from his glittering Ruby prize and saw that life had left her body. He knelt, and not without tenderness, closed her eyes with his finger tips. "Because I can."


# Fencing the Stone #

The Ruby Necklace danced across the oak counter like a living thing. Rattick nodded at it and asked, "Have you ever seen such exquisite workmanship?"


Boltac, the merchant on the other side of the counter, picked up the Ruby Necklace and looked at it closely. He gave Rattick a hard look as he licked his thumb, then he rubbed at the setting and muttered, "you missed a spot."

"Missed a spot?" asked Rattick as smooth as water over river rock. 

"Blood, Rattick. There's some blood left on this necklace."

Rattick shrugged. "Probably mine. I try to use stealth, but the Orc I took it from put up quite a fight."

"En-henh," Boltac said as rubbed a hand across his shaved head, "Not that I want to know, but what is an Orc?"

"A fearsome new creature wreaking havoc on the good people of Robrecht."

"En-henh," said Boltac, not buying it, "And, you uh, count yourself among those good people?" 

"Of course. I am no mighty hero, like some, but I do the small part that I can."

"Okay, Rattick, I'm gonna make you an offer on your necklace here. The setting is crap, but the stone is very nice. But before I do, not for nuttin' but Orcs? You're shittin' me right?"

"Oh no, stout merchant, I assure you, Orc's are very real."

"Really? Kobolds, I heard of. Trolls, I heard of. Dragons, sure, but Orcs? C'mon. What does an Orc look like?"

"Gentle Merchant, I hope that you never see one, but I assure you, if you do, you will know it is an Orc."

"En-henh,"

"Let me tell you the fearsome tale of how I came to acquire this necklace and then perhaps you will understand the fearsome Orc--"

"You can spare me the story, Rattick," said Boltac.

"You don't enjoy tales of valor?" asked Rattick with a smile.

"Tales of Valor? No. I enjoy tales of profit."

"I don't know any sagas that involve tales of profit," said Rattick, "But tales of valor, of great daring... The bards sing many songs of those."

"Yeah, I don't really care for singing either. In fact, let's just cut all the bullshit. I'm pretty sure I know the true story how you got this."

"Yessssss," purred Rattick, running his finger over the Ruby, "but do you care?"

"Not if you'll take 15 gold for it I don't."

"15 gold, why I risked my neck for this!""

"You? I'm pretty sure you risked somebody else's neck for this particular bauble. Fine, 17 for the gem, and 2 gold for the rest of it." Boltac said, indicating the pile of equipment on the floor. 

"But this sword almost defeated a troll!"

"Yeah, and it almost doesn't have that huge nick in it. And why does everything in that pile smell like Troll shit?"

They haggled like this for a while, finally settling on 22 gold for the lot. When Rattick left the store, Boltac muttered a curse and refrained from spitting on his own floor. 

He placed the Ruby in one of three lockboxes behind the counter and then dragged the bundle of equipment into the back to see how bad he had been taken. The sword was higher quality than he had hoped for, and there were a number of items that, while they wouldn't fetch top price, would provide good use. The odd piece of armor, some leather goods. He threw out a badly damaged boot was debating opening a nondescript fabric sack. Sacks could be trouble. For that matter so could gems. 

He walked back to the front of the store. He reached under the counter and, after some effort, removed a heavy, brass-tipped magic wand from it's mounting. He took the wand to the back and guided it carefully over all the items. 

The wand did not grow warm or shriek or vibrate or any one many colorful and destructive things the wand did in the presence of magic. Strictly speaking it was not a magic wand, it was a magic *detecting* wand. Very rare, very expensive. But, for a man in dealing in items of unknown origins delivered by questionable characters, it was indispensable. 

"Ennh," grunted Boltac, more relieved than disappointed. Boltac hated magic. It wasn't just dangerous, it was also bad for business. When a customer can't try on a pair of gloves for fear that they would turn out to be MaGrief's Gauntlets of Self-Abuse, business suffered. 

That's why he kept the wand underneath the counter. Pick up a cursed Ruby Necklace and there was no telling what might happen. Before he had procured his wand, he had spend six months with a cursed Goblet of Thirst stuck to his hand. As annoying as that was, that wasn't the worst part of the curse. When liquid --  any liquid -- was poured into the the Goblet, it heated and burned the hand that held it.

He rubbed the scarred flesh of his left hand. Magic, ugh. It seemed like it should be useful, but it's power always went awry. Maybe it was fate. Maybe it was karma. Maybe it was that Wizards enjoyed a particularly cruel and ironic sense of humor. Whatever it the reason was, Boltac was certain that the world would be better off without magic. But there was nothing to be done about it. People may revile a merchant, but in the end, he can only sell what the buyers want. 

The copper bell clattered against the front door. Boltac concealed the wand in his sleeve and hurried to see what profit Fortune had seen fit to bring him this time. 


# Hitting the Kid With the Stick (Covered in Glory) #

>add Boltac stubbornly refusing to use the kid's name as a funny bit. 

Boltac found a strapping young farm boy staring at a rack of swords with an open mouth. The boy was so entranced by the cold and lethal steel on the wall that he didn't even look at Boltac when he entered the room. Boltac replaced the magic detecting wand in it's hiding place then asked, "Can I help you?"

"I need a sword," said the farm boy, his eyes not leaving the weaponry. 

"Then you have come to right place. Welcome, my young friend, to Boltac's General Store and Dungeon Outfittery. We have everything that a strapping young adventurer like yourself could need to loot your way to fame and glory."

"We?" asked the lad, with the kind of innocence that can only come from hard work, clean living and getting kicked in the head by livestock. 

"Yes, the Royal We, or, in this case, the Shopkeeper's We."

"But there is only one of you?"

"Yes, but I am so eager to help you, I will work as hard as two men. Now, what's the story? Who you gotta stab? Who you gonna loot?"

"No," said the FarmBoy hanging his head in embarrassment, "It's  not like that. I don't want to loot anybody. I. I just have to rescue-- I mean, I am about to embark on an adventure of high purpose and consequence." With this last phrase, Boltac's hopes rose. Maybe the kid was a little slow, but those fancy words sounded like money.

"My friend, you have come to the right place. High purpose and consequence is what we are all about at Boltac's. Why the Duke of Robrecht himself has granted me my license to purvey. He has an eye to quality, his Dukeship does, and his warrant of commerce personally guarantees that this," he indicated his dark, dusty store with an expansive gesture of his hands, "Is the finest merchandise you can buy in town of Robrecht."

"But, it's the only merchandise I can buy in the town of Robrecht."

"Yes, I see that you are a quick study," said Boltac, directing the young man through the shelves. "I invite you to direct your keen wit towards my wares. Here we have an assortment of torches and oil bearing devices. If you notice this one, with the curved blade on the handle -- particularly good if you are surprised coming around a corner.

"Here, of course, we have our major and minor healing potions. A must for any prudent adventurer. These potions are brewed by the finest Mercian apothecaries and brought in by mule train once a moon. "

"And here is the Armor. a must for all but barbarians and the most self-confident magic workers. You aren't a magic worker are you?"

"I don't think so," said the lad, a little overwhelmed by how fast this was all coming at him. 

"Perfect, then you have your choice of chain mail, splint mail, ring mail, plate mail, plate armor and  -- far less protection but the girls love it -- leather armor. Feel that? Very supple."

"But what I need is a sword."

"Maybe you do and maybe you don't. Keep an open mind for me. We've got Pikes, Bows, Warhammers, Battle Axes, Halberds, Flails, Morningstars, Maces and the largest selection of Fine Daggers this side of the mountains."

"I don't want a mace. I want a sword."

"Of course you do. And once again, Boltac's has you covered! We've got short swords, long swords, broadswords,  rapiers, cutlasses, sabers, scimitars, shishkas, and slabas -- and I did I mention the finest selection of Daggers of quality, this side of the mountains. While it's true that most of our blades have never been tested in battle, this is in keeping with our philosophy of passing the savings and the glory on to you."

"Well, uh, I'm afraid..."

"Afraid? A big strapping lad like you? Don't be ridiculous. Why, after you've been properly outfitted by Uncle Boltac, you'll have nothing to fear in this world. You'll be able to take on a Dragon with one hand and an OwlBear with the other. And therein lies the value of quality equipment."

"No, it's just that, I'm afraid that those beautiful swords," his eyes grew wide as he looked at them, "are all too expensive for me." 

The smile drained from Boltac's face, but he continued as if he hadn't just been kicked in the wallet. "Don't be silly. At Boltac's we have equipment to fit every budget." He kicked a bucket of swords next the counter. "Have a look at our discount bucket."

"This sword still has blood on it!"

"That's how you know that it works! A gold piece gets you the pick of the barrel."

"A gold piece?" said the lad, looking concerned. 

"Well," said Boltac, who was starting to get a very bad feeling about the entire transaction, "At Boltac's there's always room to negotiate. But try a few, see how you like the balance.""
 
"I've been trying to save money to buy a sword, sir. Scrounging for herbs, seeing if anyone needs rats killed. But no one needs rats killed. And the countryside is bare for miles aroundâ€¦" He trailed off.

Boltac nodded understandingly. The only vermin that plagued Robrecht was an infestation of down-on-their luck adventurers. "I understand how it is. And how much have you been able to save?"

"Not enough, I'm afraid. So I was wondering if I could rent a sword."

"RENT A SWORD?" Boltac shouted. "Do you not see the sign?" he asked pointing at the sign which clearly read "All Sales Final."

"I can't read, sir."

"Oh, of course not."

"Please sir, it's so I can rescue the love of my life. She was taken, you see. By the evil wizard Oddna."

"Oh well, that changes everything," said Colbac, as his face grew hard. "Tell me more," he asked, as if it was a dare.

"Well sir, she is a priestess of Dar. And, well,"

"Aren't they supposed to be virgins? The priestesses of Dar."

The young man blushed and said, "It's more of a suggestion, than a rule, sir. If you know what I mean," his face grew serious, "but if it helps, I was a virgin, if you catch my drift."

"Help? How would that help?"

"She's gone and got herself into trouble. I've gotten word from a friend that she's being held in a tower by an Evil Wizard."

"Yes, yes, yes. And they are always *evil* wizards aren't they?"

"I knew you would understand. So, if I had a sword, I could go and rescue her. And there would probably be treasure after I defeated the Wizard. And I would give it all to you," 

Boltac winced a little under the onslaught of the boy's sincerity. "But just a sword? I mean, armor would help too?"

"Yes, it would, butâ€¦"

"And some healing potions, you know, just to be safe."

"Well, of course, but"

"And perhaps a flying steed. White, with large flapping wings."

"You have a flying steed?" the boy asked in awe. 

"Even if I did, you couldn't afford it."

"But, we're talking about a loan."

"No, *you're* talking about a loan. You're gonna have to find yourself another Priestess of Eternally Questionable Virtue, kid."


"Look, I'm not asking for armor or a flying horse, I'm just asking to borrow a sword."

Boltac looked the boy dead in the eyes and said, "I'm not giving you any discounts."

"It's not a discount. It's a loan."

"It's the worst kind of discount of all. It's a 100% discount."

"But I'd bring it back. Maybe with a few nicks, but definitely covered in glory."

"Oh Glory is it? That would enhance the retail value?"

"Yes, yes," he said eagerly, unaware of the trap he was falling into.

"Because you are such a great fighter."

"Yes, that's it."

"Powerful, strong," Colbac prompted.

"Yes."

"Ready for danger from any quarter."

"I might not look like much, sir, but I'll be a mighty hero yet."

"All you need is a sword? Is that right?"

"Yes, please, Sir. Please. Haven't you ever been young and in love?"

Boltac's face soured. "I was never young.

"Look, kid, I'm not going to loan you a sword. But I do have an old mace I keep behind the counter, you know, in case of trouble. It's not much to look at, but it's always been lucky for me. I like to think it would be good luck ofr you. Would you like to see it?"

"Very much."

Boltac lifted the mace up from behind the counter. As he raised the weapon high in the air, the lad's trusting, cow-like eyes followed it, studying every detail of the well-worn wood, wrapped leather handle, and the business end studded with heavy iron nails. Boltac saw the lad move from disappointment to to hope. "Yes," his eyes seemed to say, "a mace. I could do it with a mace."

Boltac hit him right between the eyes, and knocked him out cold.

# WIZARD v DUKE #

[^give the wizard some kind of tag so we know him when he talks to Boltac]:

In the center of Robrecht, there was a river. In the center of the river was an island occupied by a very damp castle. And in the very damp center of this very damp castle was a Duke on a throne. 

The Duke yawned mightily, then thought the better of it. He was holding court, such as court was in the remote and unimpressive Dutchy of Robrech. There were no glittering courtiers, there were no ladies-in-waiting, there was just the Duke, an uncomfortable wooden chair and a long line of disputes that the Duke was supposed to settle before he would be allowed to go to his supper. 

"Messers Rudolph and Fuad, herders of goats!" the Chamberlain announced. The Duke waved his hand in acknowledgement and the men were brought before him.  

"He had advantage of my goat, sire. And I desire compensation," said the cross-eyed man as glared in the approximate direction of the man next to him. The Duke turned his gaze at the accused, a man who was wearing a goat-skin helmet. Was the helmet this man's idea of formal dress, the Duke wondered? The Duke opened his mouth as if to speak, but then thought better of it. 

The pause stretched to a such a length that the Chamberlain gently prompted, "Sire?"

"Advantage?" asked the Duke, unable, with his formal, courtly upbringing, to understand how having a goat might be an advantage. It's not that there were no goats in the Mercian Empire. It's that he had been insulated from all creatures that were shaggy and uncultured from the time he had left the womb.

"He had knowledge of my best NannyGoat."

"Knowledge? I don't understand, of course he has knowledge of your animal," he said, glancing at the dull-eyed, leather-helmeted man who was being accused of bestiality, "he is a fellow-goatherd, is he not?"

"No my lord," said the cross-eyed man, blushing with the weight of what he must now make painfully obvious. "He..." and he thrust his pelvis forward and backwards in an unmistakeable, rhythmic motion. 

"Oh. Oh? OH!" said the Duke, as facts of the case came into focus for him. "Really. What was it like?" asked the Duke.

The Chamberlain began to cough. This was a pre-arranged signal between the two that the Duke was wandering dangerously off course. The Chamberlain did a lot of coughing. 

"Very well," the Duke said, "I command you to violate one of his sheep."

"WHAT!"

"Yes, yes, my good man, that is justice. He has had one of yours, so you must have one of his. An eye for an eye and a ewe for a ewe. Yes, that has the ring of justice to it. Symmetry." The Duke said, feeling awfully proud of himself. But by the look on the goatherd's face, he could see that his legal acumen was lost on the man. 

The Chamberlain continued to cough. The Duke became worried about how he might talk his way out of his ruling without seeming that he was contradicting himself. The Duke, was aware, vaguely, that he was not the sharpest arrow in the quiver. But he was straight on one point: The only mortal sin a person in power might truly commit was seeming to contradict themselves. 

He couldn't understand where he had gone wrong? What taboo had he crossed? It was a perfectly logical verdict. He was a perfectly logical ruler. And why did rulers have to explain themselves to their subjects anyway? Maybe it was just Dukes. He was pretty sure if he was a King he wouldn't have had to explain himself to anyone. 

Just has he was thinking that, a Wizard appeared in the great hall. And this is not to say he made an entrance. One minute there was an empty space on the cold stone floor and the next, there he stood. Shaven pate, black robes, dark circles under his eyes, strange stains underneath his fingernails -- one moment he wasn't there, and the next, he was. The Wizard Appeared.  

There was a gasp as those in the great hall, jumped back from the man who had appeared in their midst. Nonplussed, the Chamberlain said, "A man appearing from nowhere!" 

The Wizard looked at the Chamberlain sharply and hissed, "My name is Alston Dimsbury."

"Dimsbury, A wizard of considerable evil," the Chamberlain said. But the wizard's look darkened and more imaginative people in the crowd believed that they saw flames forming in the Wizard's eyes. 

"â€¦who's reputation is much maligned," the Chamberlain added diplomatically. 

"Yes, enough, that's quite enough," said the Duke. "Wizard, you will simply have to wait your turn."

"Oh," said the Wizard. "I hope this isn't convenient for you. I *am* sorry. Pray, continue with your amusements. My time is of little consequence." He punctuated his sentence with a wave of his hand that turned the cross-eyed goatherd in a rather lovely-looking brown and white nanny goat. This time, even the Chamberlain gasped in fear. 

Fuad, the Goatherd in the leather helmet, smiled at the newly-minted goat with an unwholesome gleam in his eye. As he rubbed his hand along the length of rope that held up his trousers, the Nanny goat gave up a fearful bleat.

The Wizard said, "Please, don't let me interrupt."

No one spoke. The only sound was the clacks of the goat's hooves as she/he wisely made for the exit as fast as her/his terribly confused legs would carry her.

Exasperated that the still crowd wasn't getting the point, the Wizard said, "What does it take? Must I strike all of you down with a pillar of flame? Gah. Let me outline it for you.  I am a *horrible* man. Dimsbury the terrible. Master of the arcane arts and elder mysteries, summoner of demons, so on and so forth, so GIVE ME THE ROOM. Now, go. Flee."

And so they did. And when the oaken door slammed behind them, the Wizard and the Duke were the only people left in the room. 

"There," said the Wizard, "That's better."

"Hullo, Alston, enjoying yourself?"

"Quite Weevston. You know how I do like to make an entrance."

"I apologize for my subjects," said the Duke, "they are a bit... provincial."

"Thick is the word I would have used."

"Would you care for some wine," asked the Duke as he draped his leg over the side of his chair and slumped with the false exhaustion that only comes with never having worked a day in your life.

"I want you to *get out*," said the Wizard.

"Uh? Pardon me?"

"I said, get out. Abdicate. Leave this place. And take everyone with you."

"I wish that I could," said the Duke, "I never wanted to come to this damp, grey place to begin with."

"Ah, well there you go," said the Wizard, "I love it when things are easy. Did you say there was wine?"

"Sadly," said the Duke.

"Sadly? I thought you said there was wine?"

"Oh wine? We've got it by the barrelful. And by the bottleful in cabinet over there. Since you've run off all my servants, subjects and goat herders, you will have help yourself. All told this tower and keep contains more wine than I could drink in three lifetimes. Although the prospect of staying here for three lifetimes," the Duke chuckled as he made a slicing motion across his throat."

"I don't think you understand," said the Wizard, trying to be reasonable, "this is a courtesy call. What I mean to say is that this request is for your benefit, not mine."

"Steady on, old boy," said the Duke. "I'm on your side. I'm ready to do as you command. You want this kingdom -- well this dismal little duchy -- I say you can have it. Good riddance to fickle mountain weather, thick-ankled peasant girls and goat violators of every shape and stripe. But, here's the thing, I can't. The minute I leave my post, my family will know of it. In particular my Uncle Torvald, do you know my Uncle Torvald?"

"Can't say I have had the pleasure," said Dimsbury, fighting back an urge to engulf the Duke in flames with a clap of his hands. 

"I have the burden of carrying a great name. Weaveston Prestidigitous RampartLion Toroble the 15th, in fact. And this name means that I am not free do what I would like. I am not free to marry who I like. I am not free to live where I like. I have been sent here. And if I abdicate, Torvald Toroble will have me killed. Either by assassin or generalship of an army on it's way to a glorious lost cause or perhaps just with a good old-fashioned hunting accident."

"How do you know?" asked Wizard, still trying to reason with him. 

"It's how he did my father. Hunting "accident." And when dear old Dad survived that, then Torvalds sent his very own doctor to poison the man."

"Damn it, man," cried Alston, "I'm trying very hard not to be the stereotypical Evil Wizard. But you're just not helping. I don't want to be a stereotype. Don't make me be a stereotype."

"I never suggested that you were," said the Duke, with a look of care on his face.

"I could have swept in from the East and just taken that mine and cavern system for myself. Killed all the miners, released horrible creatures into the countryside. Right? Could have done that, couldn't I?"

"Yes, Alston you could have, but I don't feel that you are the kind of --"

"But instead, I bought that mine. Paid gold on the barrel head for it. Didn't I?"

"You did. Please, Alston, what has gotten into you? You are a fine neighbor." said the Duke, trying to tell this powerful and somewhat crazed man what he wanted to hear. 

"Yes, I am," the Wizard said, calming enough to take a healthy gulp of wine. "I am a fine neighbor, but you, and I mean the royal you, Duke Robrecht, are not."

"Ugh, Robrecht as a name. Why it sounds simply ghastly, doesn't it."

"Your subject are the ghastly bits. Those little people who infest this land. With their grubbing in the dirt and milking of animals."

"Ah, taxpayers," said the Duke, "Yes, my Uncle says I am here to farm them."

"Herd them? Wouldn't herd be the word you're looking for?"

"Yes, I suppose it would. I am to herd them until tax time. And then I shear them and release them back into their fields."

"Look, dear man, it's not your sheep that are the problem. Nor your goats. The problem is the relents press of adventurers seeking to steal what they imagine is the vast repository of treasure stashed in my dungeon."

"You have treasure, Alston? All this time you've been holding out on me?"

"No, no, heavens no. I mean a little *family* money, but nothing to speak of. I am a Wizard, a researcher into the arcane and terrible forces that undergird all of our lives."

"Sounds rather dull to me."

"Well, it's not for everyone, but my work is *important*. Deucedly important. So much so that I've nearly isolated the source of all magic in this plane of existence."

"Plane of existence?" asked the Duke, wrinkling his face in confusion.

"Sorry, sorry, don't mean to trouble you with technical terms. The thing is, If I can harness this source, tap into the very essence, why I would be the most powerful and accomplished Mage in the history of the world."

"Prize for that is there?"

"No, Weeveston, there is not. Power is it's own reward."

"Ah, yes, well, you'd have to talk to my Uncle about that."

"But not on a hunting trip?"

"Oh, ho ho, quite so. Quite so."

"The point is, I keep getting interrupted in my work. I can't get anything done. And it's your fault."

"My fault?"

"Yes, the endless stream of mendicants, adventurers and ne'er do wells who seek to kill me and deprive me of property. To become rich heroes by defeating the Evil Wizard, that's what they want!" Here the Wizard grew less sure of himself, "I'm not an *evil* wizard, am I Weeaveston? I try not to be, but some days, God I just don't know."

"No, of course you are not an Evil Wizard. I've known you since grammar school. A touch mischievous, perhaps. But Evil? No."

"Oh, thank you for saying so. I do appreciate your honesty," said the Wizard. "At first I thought the adventurers would stop coming. You know, after most of the first wave of looters fell into my traps or afoul of my pets. But failure dissuaded no one. They doubled their efforts. And then redoubled them after that!

"Most died on the upper levels, but the few that managed to penetrate deeper into my stronghold, they've caused real damage. So I have been force to turn away from my important work to employ spies and turncoats,  fashion ever more diabolical traps and oversee the painful logistics of force management and deployment. I don't want any of this, it's a constant strain and a distraction from my work. I tell you Weaveeston, I am close to a deeper knowledge and understanding of the forces that shape our world than any man has ever had before."

The Duke fixed the Wizard with a look and said, "I know what force shapes our world, and sadly, it is heredity."

But the Wizard was on a roll. "And the power! The limitless power. It should be I that make this connection with the source. Lest this power fall into the hands of some truly EVIL wizard. So I'm afraid you simply must go. There's no other way I can see it."

"I would like nothing better than to comply with your wishes, old friend. But my Uncle would have me killed. Even if I did leave, it would do you no good, he would come in force and just take the Kingdom back. And it's not like it would solve your problem. I mean I can't very well take the sheep with me. Or stop members of the herd from seeking you out and troubling your in your research."

 "Yes, Weeveston, I suppose your right. I just -- you know, the long hours of study, the feeling of limitless power at one's finger tips. I just thought there must be some way to solve this problem."

"Of course, old boy. Perfectly understandable. Perhaps I could lend you some of my guards, to help ease the burden. But heavens knows my Uncle leaves me precious little enough to staff an army. Really more of a garrison. A bunch of drunks in helmets, honestly."

"Yes, I know, we all have our problems. I'm sorry Weeveston, I've been an ass. I've barged in unannounced, I've hit your man with Tilhphad's spell of Transformation. Threatened you with ultimatums. I swear Weaveeston, on my mother's grave, the soil of which is indispensable for the making of certain potions, I never wanted to be an Evil Wizard. A screeching, fire-throwing caricature of myself. But the world... the world will simply drive a man to it."

"Ah, hmm, yes." said the Duke. "You should meet my Aunt Etheline."

"Torvalds' wife?"

"Oh no, he had her killed long ago. Needlepoint "accident."" He has something of a penchant for killing relatives. No Etheline is his sister. And compared to him *she* is the *ruthless* one."

"Well, that makes me feel better."

"Better?"

"Yes, I would never do such a thing to my own family."

"Your extended family doesn't own and fight over estates and dominions that cover nearly a third of the known world."

"Perhaps you have a point. But *I* would draw the line at assassinating my own family."

"I do as well," said the Duke with an air of resignation, "But only because I don't have the means or talent to get away with it." 

"Oh and I should mention, I've dispatched a raiding party."

"Raiding party, well that doesn't sound so bad. I mean, it's understandable in a fit of temper and all. "

"Of Orcs,"

"Orcs? What are those?"

"They ride wolves, Weeveston. Wolves."

"Well whatever they are, they can't be very large if they are riding wolves."

"They are very large wolves."

"Yes, but what is a Horc?"

"No, no, good fellow, an Orc. No 'h'. They are my latest work. Terrible, terribly murderously bloodthirsty creatures. Stronger and faster than a man. Some cultivars have tusks, other do not. They all have greyish-green skin, almost impervious to weapons -- if not for the constant interruptions I would have perfected that.

"Look, it's important that you know how badly I feel about this. Wiping out your entire Kingdom--" at the sound of the world Kingdom, the Duke flinched. "Oh, sorry, sorry, Duchy. Very sorry about that, didn't mean to rub it in.

"Anyway, I feel terrible about all of this old boy, really I do. but it seems the only way to get the peace in which I need to work."

"Well, I understand, you were upset, but it's just a raiding party. Probably do the old town some good. A little raiding. Till up the soil, attract more adventurers. Rallying to the cry of defend good ol' Robrecht!"

"No, no that's not the point. You see, old boy, I mean to drive you out. Work salt into the earth so nothing will ever grow here again."

"Wait, how many people in this raiding party? I mean how many of these Horks?"

"Orcs"

"â€¦do you have?"

"Oh, a few thousand, by now I should say!"

"!h, well, why didn't you say so?" exclaimed the Duke, breaking out into a smile.

"What difference does it make?"

"Well if it two dozen our so, it would be a mere raiding party. But a thousand, perhaps two. Yes, two thousand?"

"I'm a wizard," said the Wizard, "Just not with numbers."

"Well, a quick look at the treasury will reveal that neither am I. But, anything over 500 is clearly an army."

"So?"

"Well, I wouldn't have abdicated, I would have been INVADED!"

"Yes."

"Well, for me it's no problem. I just slip away into the night. The warmth of exile in the Southern Kingdoms and the embrace of my wife --"

"Weeveston, you got married?"

"Oh, yes, for ages now. Arranged, but she is pleasant enough, as wives go. But she took one look at this damp tower left me. She repaired to her father's estates in the south. Something about mold growing in her hair.

"But never mind that now. You have released me old friend. You have released me! I will instruct my household to pack at once. "

"Probably for the best. The Orcs should descend on the town shortly after midnight."

"Oh, how very gruesome and terrifying."

"Yes, I thought it a nice touch."

"The only thing old boy," the Duke said, the smile dropping from his face, "Is my Uncle. He will take it hard. He will come for revenge."

"No worries, Weeveston. I can handle your Uncle Torvalds."

"I wish you would."

"As a favor to you, I am happy to do it," said the Wizard. The he said, "Bon Voyage!" gave a half-bow, and, in the way of Wizards, he disappeared in puff of smoke.

# Propping the Kid Up



From Wizard's point of view -- walking to the Inn -- knowing that that they have good Lamb -- Later, after a fine repast he would remove himself to a high hilltop and watch the city burn. A pleasant break from his usual toil. 

Boltac -- good city for business. 
Wizard -- hmm, yes, so far. 
Boltac -- Lots of trade

Wizard -- but what happens when all the adventurers are killed?

Botlac raised an eyebrow, "What do you mean, when all of the adventurers are killed? There's always more adventurers. Each fresh crop of children brings new fools willing to risk their life. Trust me, I've made fortune off of this.""

"But what if everyone was defeated? So badly, so horribly, that it set an example? Lots of heads on pikes, that kind of thing."

"Ennnhh," Boltac said, holding up one finger. "That sounds like reason. I mean it makes fine sense to me, but here's the thing -- you can't reason with fools. At least not without becoming a fool yourself."

"Yes," said the Wizard, sighing into his ale, "That is most certainly *the thing*."


--- 

Boltac dragged the unconscious Farm Boy out the front door by the shoulders. He placed him on the ground, then locked the shop door. Across the street, Boltac saw an empty bench in front of the Bent Eelpout Tavern. Perfect, thought Boltac. 

As he dragged lad across the street, Boltac muttered, "What were you thinking? Loan you a sword? Are you crazy? Well, of course your crazy." With much grunting, Boltac struggled to prop the lad up on a bench in front of the Bent Eelpout Tavern. He looked up at the hideous, twisted fish on the Tavern's faded sign and a longing for ale filled him. 

"Look kid," he said to the gently snoring boy on the bench, "It's for you own good. I mean, if you didn't see that coming, you're not going to see anything else coming. And that wasn't even tricky. You know what's tricky? Wizards are tricky."

Boltac watched the boy breathing in his sleep. He seemed even younger now that he was unconscious. After a moment he said, "Okay, no charge for the concussion. And you're  welcome." and went inside the tavern.  


# Borrow a Cup of Ale #

With a slurping noise, Boltac sucked the marrow from a leg of lamb. Then he wiped his chin with a trencher of bread, sucked a mighty gulp of ale and said, "Asarah, I will wager that you make the finest lamb of any wench in any tavern in any land."

"You're a bold man, to call the mistress of the house a wench in her own establishment," answered the dark-haired woman behind the bar, pretending to be upset. 

"It is because someday, I will make an honest woman of you."

"It will take a better man than you."

"A better man than I would fall afoul of your charms and be ruined. I am cunning, I have a fortune, I will tame you yet."

Asarah laughed and returned to the kitchen. It was an old game she played with most all of her customers, but with Boltac, somehow it was different. For one thing, he was not just another traveller. He was a man of standing in the town of Robrecht. A merchant who kept his store across the street from the inn. He was rumored to have a great fortune, but there was always a worried sadness about him. And if he had a fortune, why did he stay here. He could have gone anywhere in the four Kingdoms. Why would anyone stay in this clammy, dismal center of the nowhere called Robrecht?

He was not what you would call handsome. His hair had thinned and beneath his broad shoulders he was running to fat. That didn't bother Asarah. Neither did the the fact that he always tried to cheat her on his bill. Claiming that she had overcharged him, or that an ale was bad halfway through didn't bother her either. Supposedly he was wealthy enough to drink in any Inn or establishment he wanted. With the Duke, even, but he always seemed to wind up back at the Bent Eelpout. 

It was a strange courtship, to be sure. But, pretty as she was, Asarah was no spring maid any more. And courtship, any courtship was a flattery to be welcomed. Since her husband had passed and left her freighted and weighed with the responsibility's of a 

Besides, Boltac could have  

Asarah dropped two roast chickens and another leg of lamb at a table and scanned the room. At this instant everyone was fed and watered and aled. She had the moment to herself. Tucking her tray under her arm she made her way back to the bar. 

"Asarah, can I borrow an ale," asked Boltac. 

"I hate to think what condition you'll give it back to me." She quipped and was pleased to see that he smiled back.

"I promise, it will be liquid. But seriously, can I borrow an ale?"

"What? No. Who asks such a thing?"

"Exactly!" said Boltac, pounding his fist on the bar. "Who asks such a thing? But people do. I swear to heaven they do. A young man, not 20 minutes ago, walked into my store and had the nerve to ask me if he could borrow a sword."

"What? You mean like you'd ask a neighbor to borrow a cup of sugar."

"Yes, exactly. Except when you borrow a cup of sugar, you don't go off and use it to get yourself killed trying to save some damn fool... Priestess of Dar. 

"Oh, virgin love," she said with a look in her eye that made Boltac realize that shattering her illusions about the Priestess of Dar would be the wrong thing to do. 

"Hmmm," he said into his beer. 

"So, did you loan him the sword?"

"No," snapped Boltac, foam flying from his lips. "I hit him over the head with a club, dragged him across the street and left him unconscious on the bench out front."

Now her eyes flashed dark against the wave of her hair. "How *could* you?" 

"It was easy, actually, I just took my... Look, woman. When you pick up a sword you pick up a lot of other things with it. And if the lad wasn't ready to deal with the ambush of a shopkeeper with a bad leg, then he certainly wasn't ready to deal with whatever dangerous and vile thing he meant to bash in the head to preserve the honor of his wench."

"That word again, Wench, you said she was a priestess."

"Same difference."

"It's not and you know it," said Asarah. "Don't you see? How romantic it is?"

"I see how stupid it is."

"No," said Asarah, growing upset. "That's how she will know. The only way she can know!"

"Know what, that he's an idiot."

"The girl, she's in danger right?"

"I think it was something more along the lines of a fight for her honor, but sure, let's say she's in danger."

"Danger. She's been kidnapped, let's say. And she's being held captive at the bottom of horrible dungeon."

"Certainly are plenty of horrible dungeons around Robrecht," said Boltac, looking around the room as if he wished the subject would change itself. 

"Oh, it's so romantic. And he goes to rescue her and when he *does* rescue her that's how she *knows*."

"Knows what?"

"That he loves her. That he really, truly loves her above all others."

"That's how she'll know he's a muscle-headed idiot who's good with a sword."

"But he can't because some fat, greedy merchant wouldn't loan him a sword."

"No," said Boltac, pushing his anger back down, "I could loan him a sword and armor and everything else in my store. He can't because he DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO USE A SWORD!"

"Keep your voice down," hissed Asarah. You're disturbing the other patrons!"

"Patron," quipped Boltac across his empty tankard. 

Asarah slammed a full ale down in front of him and said. "There's no romance in your life. No passion. I feel sorry for you Boltac." And then she stormed off into the back. 

"Safer that way," Boltac muttered into the foam of his first sip. 


[[ and then, thinking better of it, he took a sword off the rack -- not his best sword and not his worst -- walked across the street and hung the sword belt around the neck of the unconscious boy. 

As he looked at him. Boltac wondered, was he all that different. At that age? The madness of youth? The kind that drives a young man to abandon his family, travel, see the world. Fall in love? Seek adventures? 

Maybe not. Maybe the only difference was, Boltac was just cunning enough to have survived. And that kid? Ehhh, that kid didn't stand a chance.

>She really stands on the fact that she doesn't need a husband and can take care of herself. Maybe she stands down a drunk patron.

---

Asarah -- but you see that's how she knows he loves her. He comes for her, risks everything against all odds for the love of his life. 

Boltac -- that's how she knows he's an idiot. 

Asarah -- You're a bitter, bitter man. 

Boltac -- What because I make good sense?

Asarah -- Because there's no romance in your life. No passion. No magic. 

Ugh, thought Boltac. Magic that's worse than romance


* She gives him a bit of handkerchief and lace to see if he can find more of it. He set's it as a favor on his helmet. (the ugliest helmet anyone had ever seen. That has a powerful magical ability, uniquely suited to Boltacs unusual (well unusual for an adventurer) skills.

-Isn't that right, Asarah?" but when he turned back, she was gone.

# Boltac v. Wizard


"Dimsbury," the man said, in way that irritated Boltac. A way that implied a title lurking somewhere in the wings. Who was he to put on airs? Here they were, both in The Bent Eelpout, one as good as another. If he was so high and mighty why wasn't he gnawing on the Duke's mutton? "Forgive me if I don't shake hands," Dimsbury concluding, sealing Boltac's judgement.

"She is a fine woman," said the man sitting two seats away at the bar. 

"Hunrn," grunted Boltac, for all the sentiment that gave away. When he turned he saw that the speaker was dressed in an expensive black fabric, with a sash of blue as counter point to a fancy gentleman's sword with a brilliant blue jewel in the hilt. He had the look of money about him. Boltac didn't remember seeing him when he came in. 

"Someone should do something about such adventurers," said Boltac, they are a plague on commerce and the commonwealth alike."

"Perhaps someone will," ventured the stranger, somewhat cryptically." "What business brings you to our fair city."

"Hmm, city," said the man, with shake of his head, "Ashtantis, that's a city. Squalipoor, Yorn, those are cities. This is a fish drying village with delusions of grandure."

"More like delusions of glory," said Boltac as he raised a glass, not sure he liked the other man's tone. "You have travelled then, a trader?" Asked Boltac, sniffing around for a profit. 

"More of a wandering scholar," said the man.

"What have you learned here," Boltac asked, sure that the man wasn't a scholar, but playing along anyway. 

"This is, without a doubt, the finest leg of lamb I have ever had."

Boltac smiled and said, "Tell her that." With a nod towards the kitchen, "She'll not believe me."

"Magic in the kitchen, sheer magic. I should give quite a lot to know the secrets of her art."

Boltac shrugged, "Why waste the time. Why not just come here and eat."

"Hmm, so, public, so... common."

"Yeah, well, the surroundings do leave something to be desired."
 
"What is an Eelpout?" 

"An Eelpout? You don't know what an Eelpout is?"

"I am, as they say, not from around here."

"Eeh, yeah, no doubt. So an Eelpout is, well, imagine an ugly fish."

The man with the blue sash did not change his expression. 

"Seriously, envision it in  your head."

"I am."

"Oh, well, then it's nowhere near ugly enough. It's so ugly, this Eelpout, that to think of it is to "

"I have seen a great many ugly things," said the man in a way that indicated that he, the far worldlier man, was growing tired of this exchange. 

"But you've never seen an Eelpout, is what I'm saying."

"No."

"Ugliest Godsdamned fish in the world."

"And bent?"

"Drunk, I'd guess. Probably nothing uglier in the universe than an Eelpout on a bender."

"Then why would one name an establishment after such a creature."

"No idea," said Boltac. "Mystery of it all."

"Ah, mystery."

Asarah left the kitchen with a well-ladened tray. She looked over to the bar and gave both of them one her smiles. The smile had enough wattage behind it, and she threw her hair just so, that Boltac started to rethink his position on romance. She was so beautiful, and strong. Not that he could find the words to tell her that. But having her always just a few steps across the street had been a comfort in ways that even know he didn't fully understand. 

"The only mystery," said the Stranger, "Is why someone hasn't swept such a radiant creature off her feet."

The smile fell from Boltac's face like a sheet of ice falling from a castle wall. "In the gentle words of the virgin Priestesses of Dar, come again?"

"Oh, nothing. It's just, such a rare creature. I wonder why she stays in this... squalor."

"Squalor? Buddy, I'm eatin' here."

"Oh, I meant no offense. It is what you are *used* to after all. "

"Eh, her husband owned this inn. He died and that's her hand of cards.


"Yeah, she deserves better. The Eelpout has seen better days."

"Oh, ho ho ho ho, ho," chortled the man. "You're not excepted, my grubby little merchant. She deserves better than all of you. Perhaps as a chef to an Duke or a King or someone even more powerful," he said with a flair of his nostrils.  He threw a gold piece (more than three times enough for the bill) on the bar and said, "See that she gets that, my good man." 

"Rich prick," thought Boltac. As he watched the man go he was sure that the prick made the mistake of thinking that because he had money it meant he had power. As he watched him go, he muttered a prayer to the endlessly haggling Gods of commerce, "Just get me a chance to negotiate with that guy. He won't feel so high and mighty after that, I promise you."

Since there wasn't an offer attached, the Gods of Commerce didn't hear his plea. But other, older Gods -- the ones in charge of punishing Hubris -- they heard Boltac's plea loud and clear. 

When Asarah returned, Boltac indicated the coin on the bar and said, "That's for both of us. He said you could keep the change."

"What a fine gentleman he turned out to be!" she exclaimed, marveling at the gold."

"Oh yeah, real prince of a guy. I'll take another one, when you get a chance."

# Giving the kid the sword #

---

He looked across the street to the boy he had rendered unconscious. He was unmoved and Boltac would have feared him dead, if he did not see the gentle rise and fall of the young lad's chest. He remembered when he had been his age. Young and strong and fresh off a farm of his own. A farm for to the North in a particularly hard and frozen region of Mercia, but all farms are the same -- no matter what they may grow, all farms produce a surplus of hard, boring work suitable for the endless torture of young men who crave adventure. 

He did not feel guilty to braining the lad. If it was Adventure the boy was after, he would have to withstand far worse. And if his younger self had appeared by magic before him in his own store Boltac would have done far worse. He would have tried to beat some sense into his former self. Even though he doubted it could be done. 

But how could he tell a young man of the hazards that awaited him. Of the costs to life and limb and family -- all the ways of hurt and all the ways those hurts could radiate beyond himself. It was a terrible thing to be a hero. And Boltac wished the pain of it on no one. Certainly on no one's family. 

He couldn't talk him out of it. There was simply no way to frame the words, no order to put them in that could make it through his testosterone addled brain and overcome the lust for glory. Yes, if not this priestess, he would find some other cause, or scrape or trouble. At least he wasn't off in search of that Dred Wizard that all of the other 'Adventurers' were always harassing. So few of them came back. 

But, realized Boltac, there was no stopping him. So why had he tried? Maybe because he saw himself in the lad. And would have given anything and risked everything to take back the poor choices of his own youth. 

He cursed the Bards. It was surely there fault. Putting all these ideas in young men's heads. Sending them off to war or in search of gold. But even as he did, he cursed himself. 

Damn it all. Time enough for a pint. He opened the door of the store, stepped outside, stopped and then turned around. He walked back in the store, and grabbed a sword from the sword barrel. He drew the blade and tested it's balance. Awful. He sighted down the blade? As curved as a whore's back. What an awful piece of workmanship. It was the kind of item he would willingly sell to a fool, but not the kind of weapon he would wish on his worst enemy. 

A man needed a sword he could trust. Boltac saw the shape of a terrible memory rising from the dark waters of his memory. Before the thought could full take hold of him,  slammed the sword back in the barrel. 

He went to the rack behind the counter. He removed the blade from the bottom. It was the one he would of chosen, if he were spending his own money. It was a stout, Mercian sword. At one end, it's straight blade came to a broad triangular point and the other ending with a heavy round pommel that, in the hands of someone who knew what they were doing, qualified as a weapon on it's own. It sang as he unsheathed it and begged to dance in his hand. He sighted along the blade and it's hard edge was as crisp, final unforgiving as the border between this life and the next. 

It was the kind of sword Boltac would want in his hand if he was fighting for his life. And if he had had one... No. He turned away from the mugging of guilt he knew awaited him in the alley of memory. He exited, locked the shop and walked across the slop of the muddy street.

# The Orcs Attack #

"Hork, Hork, Hork."


You know which end to hold on to?

"But I can't pay you."

"What good is money, kid? The city is burning and they stole the woman I love."



 

Across the street, he could still see the boy, Relan? Yes, he thought it was Relan, asleep on the bench in front of the inn. How peaceful he looked. Boltac hoped that he wasn't dead. He hadn't hit him that hard, had he? And if the lad couldn't survive a tap like that, than his adventures would be short and predictable indeed. Gah, the stupidity of youth.

# Headlights Outline #

*The idea is that this outline is like a view of the journey at high speed from the headlights of a car. Sure, you get the gist -- it gets you from point a to point b, but to really understand the path you take, you have to drive slowly in the daytime. Or drive it many times.*



# Counting the Coins #

Boltac returned to his store, barred the door and retrieved the heavy lockbox from beneath the counter. It hadn't been a busy day, but in dribs and drabs the coins had piled up. A bit of lace here, a poultice there, it all added up to a nice living. As his father had said, keep a store and it will keep you. And an important part of keeping a store was counting the money. 

As he poured the coins out on the counter, he looked out the window and across the square. The boy was there and still unconscious. Probably just a growing boy and needed his sleep, thought Boltac with a pang of guilt. Someone should get the kid in off the street, or else he might lose that sword Boltac had just given him. 

For a second, Boltac thought about going and getting it back, but thought better of it. If Asarah came out and saw the kid with the sword, it would go half-way to getting Boltac back in her good graces. But if she came out and caught Boltac taking the sword back, ergh, he'd never stand a chance with her again.  

He looked down and divided the coins into three piles of gold, silver and copper. He quickly counted the copper coins and made a note of them in his ledger. With the silver coins he took more time. Producing a set of weights and measures to make sure that not only the count was accurate, but also the total weight. 

Boltac was very careful throughout the day not to take any coins that had been clipped, or were too light to be pure. With copper, clipping was rarely a problem. The coins just weren't worth enough to be worth the trouble. With silver clipping became a problem, but that was spotted easily enough. It was the gold coins that presented the greatest difficulty for Boltac. 

Gold was worth enough that instead of merely clipping it, it was worth skilled counterfeiters while mix gold with lead to create a coin that seemed like gold, but was worth less than silver. 

This presented quite a problem to a merchant who did not want to be taken advantage of. It was insulting to test a customer's coin on the spot yet painful to take a loss. From a shelf beneath the counter he brought a small glass dish and bottle labeled Aqua Fortis. And strong water it was, a powerful acid used to test the purity and resolve of materials placed into it. 

Carefully pouring a little of the liquid into the dish, he began to test the coins. He dipped the edge of the first coin in and then examined it carefully. If it had turned green, it would have been a sign that the coin was some alloy, or plated lead. But the gold remained it's reassuring yellow color.  With a grunt, he started another pile on the other side of the dish. 

He went through the coins in this manner until he came to one that was false. It did not turn green when he dipped it in the acid. It did something worse. It hissed, came to life and bit his hand. 

Boltac cursed and threw the evil little coin across the room. Then he immediately regretted it. With surprising speed for a fat man, he scrabbled out from behind the counter in pursuit. 

There, in the middle of the floor, he saw the gold coin sprouted thin, insect-like legs and scrabbled for perchase against the boards. Boltac tried to stomp it and missed. He stomped again and again, hopping through his store and knocking items here and there in a strange sort of destructive dance. 

The coin scrambled under a rack of rope and strips of leather. With a roar, Boltac kicked the rack over and brought his booted foot squarely down upon the creature. 

"HA!" he cried in triumph. He dragged his foot to the other side of the room, grinding the creature across the floor until he was able to reach a set of pliers hanging on the wall. Then he bent down and, ever-so-carefully, clamped the edge of the angry, savage coin in the teeth of the pliers. 

It let out another metallic shriek, but Boltac was utterly without pity. 

He carried the coin into the back, past the foul-smelling bundle of gear he had purchase from Rattick and to a set of iron-bound chests that were sealed with fearsome-looking locks bolted to the floor. The one on the right had a hole in the top of it, sealed with a piece of cork. He removed the cork, crammed the coin into the hole -- hitting it several times with the hammer to get it to go in -- and then replaced the cork. He put his hear to the chest and waited until he heard the coin-creature settled down with a "clink."

Only after the creature was contained, did Boltac look to his hand. A fingernail-sized disc of flesh was missing from his palm and blood leaked down his forearm. Damned coin. He kicked the chest and immediately regretted it. The chest didn't move and all he got for his trouble was a hurt foot. A bad trade. Boltac looked up and smiled. 

Hanging from a nail on the wall above the chests was a small silver whistle on a leather thong. He grabbed it with his good hand and blew on it for all he was worth. Such a furious, shrieking commotion erupted from inside the chest that for a moment, Boltac worried that the chest might burst. He imagined the hundreds of coins in the cramped, dark space -- all angered -- all clawing at each other in fury and he smiled. 

Boltac had named these treacherous pieces of currency the Creeping Coins. At one time, he had thought to train them to perform, as he had seen traveling mummers train fleas, snakes, monkeys and even bears. But they were either untrainable or Boltac had lacked the knack of it. For all his time and experiments he had only earned a number of bite scars and the dubious knowledge that a certain, high-pitched frequency drove the coins mad. 

Who had created these creatures, and why? Boltac had been unable to learn. They were a species of magical creature that preferred to stay unseen, but had a most sinister method of reproduction. If you placed one of these magic coins in a pile of regular coins, they would slowly but surely convert all of the real coins to animated hunks of metal with sharp little teeth. One at time, they were an annoyance. But in the depths of a dungeon, amid a chest full of gold that might not be opened for years? These creature could turn a payday into a nightmare. Boltac hated to even imagine what that would be like. He rubbed slave into the fingernail-sized bite in his hand. It stopped the bleeding, but still hurt. What would a school of these things do? Or just a few of them under a suit of armor. He shuddered. At least death by  dragon would be quick. 

But that's the way it was with any enterprise. People feared the big things, but it was always the little things that did them in. The demons were in the details, as they said. All that work polishing your shield in preparation for a Basilisk, could all go wrong if you forgot to bring oil to protect it from rust. 

It was a terrible business, adventuring, that's why Boltac preferred to keep a shop. Oh, sure, he had heard the same songs as all the others. He had dreamed dreams of glory. But then he had grown up, settled down and learned to enjoy a warm fire and a crisp profit. He had done that lad a favor by knocking him on the head, but only if he had managed to knock some sense into him. Or not kill him. 

With a pang of guilt, he looked across the square and saw the the boy was still sleeping there. Grumbling and rubbing his hand, Boltac went in search of some salve. 





# Wizard Hears the Howl. #


The Wizard finished the last bite of his supper and took a moment to marvel at how delicious the mutton had been. It was so good that he considered ordering another whole dinner. But there was no time. He had completed his errand and should really leave the city before the carnage started. But perhaps he should take a leg of mutton to go. 

It was so hard to get good food at the bottom of his dungeon. Yes, he had servants, but they were creations. Not flesh and blood. They viewed roasting as an information gathering technique, or at best a method of discipline,  not as essential part of cuisine. And spices? Well, the ones that needed to eat, ate raw flesh. It was practice that guaranteed to keep a palate unrefined. 

None of this even touched on the horrid nature of his decor and living conditions in general. Of course, the Wizard could have taken some pains on his own behalf, but there was his work to think of. All else paled in comparison to that. But here, even in this relatively homely inn, the Wizard felt a longing for comfort he had almost forgotten he could have. A woman' touch, yes, that was the phrase. 

When the wench came around again, he asked,"Do you make sandwiches? You know, to go."

"My sandwiches are so good, men have proposed to me after the first bite," said Asarah with a playful toss of her hair. 

Outside, a wolf howled.

"What was that?" Asarah asked, her smile not falling away, but becoming tinged with concern. 

She had a nice smile, and the Wizard thought it was all the sweeter for being mixed with fear. Oh yes, thought the Wizard, he would definitely by taking something to go. "It sounded like a wolf," he said with exaggerated innocence, "I'd like two mutton sandwiches," he said with a smile.

"Lettuce and Tomato?" asked Asarah.

"However you like them."

"Well, you could just enjoy the hospitality of the Bent Eelpout and take fresh ones with you in the morning. Evidently, there are wolves about."

The Wizard smiled again. "But what assurance do I have that it will still be here in the morning."

"What, the sandwich?"

"No, the Inn."


# Boltac, WTF ? #


When Boltac heard the howl, he looked up and out the front window. Across the square he saw the boy, still sleeping in the moonlight. He stood there, motionless for a moment, with the last gold coin clamped in his pliers. Then he shrugged and touched the coin to the acid. When it did not come to life and attack him, he dropped it in the pile with the others. 

He poured the acid back into the bottle and wiped down the counter. Then he gathered up the coins and  carried them into the back. He placed them in the chest with the rest of the normal coins and then turned his attention to the pile of soiled goods he had purchase from Rattick. 

He looked up and out the front of the store. There was a flash of grey. And then again. It filled the window and was gone. 

Boltac walked forward slowly. Not sure what was going on, but pretty sure that he didn't like it. In the distance he heard someone sound a horn? Then, far, far off in the distance, a woman screamed. 

The square was empty when he stepped outside. To the North, across the river, he saw the red glow of fire. Ah, Raiders. Boltac shook his head. He knew this game all too well. He had hoped, for once, that the Duke's garrison was strong enough to keep the raiders out, or perhaps his rule could have lasted a little bit longer. But the tariffs and taxes from a crossroads town like Robrecht were valuable. And all the nobles of the world passed it back and forth like a toy. 

Now they weren't even pretending to install a king anymore. No more illusion of Robrecht being it's own kingdom (if ever it had been such) now it was a mere protectorate. "En-henh," Boltac grumbled. It seemed there was not much protection to be had in a protectorate. 

Maybe if the Duke released his tax collectors on the invaders. That might do it. Boltac shook his head and went inside. He pulled his stool out from behind the counter and set to loading crossbows. Just let them come for his, thought Boltac, they would pay in full. 

Across the square, he saw Dimsbury emerge from the Tavern holding a two mutton sandwiches wrapped in parchment. 

"Heh," said Boltac, "They come across the river and this prick is sure in for a surprise." 

Dimsbury noticed the lad, still asleep on the bench. He looked him up and down. Then he nudged the lad with his toe. 

"Some adventurer," muttered Boltac, "doesn't even wake up. Did I ever do that kid a favor."

Dimsbury reached into his pocket and produced a whistle. When he put it to his lips and blew it produced a slightly lower note than the whistle Boltac had used on the coins. He sounded the note three times, and then waited. 

Boltac heard them coming before he saw them. It sounded like a crowd of people saying something like, "Hork, Hork, Hork, Hork!" From the darkness, they rode into view on wolves. The largest wolves Boltac had ever seen. The animals were barely tame. As they advanced they snarled and snapped at at each other and their riders. 

Whistles, thought Boltac, I knew they did it with whistles!

Boltac shrank back from the window, as one of the wolves sniffed at it and fogged the glass. What in God's name were they? And the men that rode on their backs, were more animal than man. Greyish green skin, looking thick, but not scaled. Evil little eyes set too close together, small mouths filled with teeth, looking as if they would gnaw rather than chew. Large noses as a counterpoint to pointed ears too high on the skull to be human. 

"Ah," thought Boltac, "These would be Orcs." There was no way Rattick had fought one of these things. And there was no way they wore jewelry. Maybe a necklace made of ears, but not expensive rubies. 

The Orcs converged on  Dimsbury. For a moment Boltac thought the wolves would tear the man's face off. But then Dimsbury said something and the growls and snarls changed to frightened whimpers. Two of the Orcs dismounted and the wolves ran away. The Orcs moved to chase after their mounts, but a sharp bark from the Dimsbury stopped them. Who was this man who commanded monsters? 

Boltac sighted his crossbow on the Dimsbury, and then thought better of it. After all, he wasn't involved in this transaction. He should stay calm, keep his head down and hope they passed his store by. That was the surest way to avoid a loss in this situation. At least that's what his head told him. But his heart offered a different commentary when he saw the two Orc's kick in the door of the Bent Eelpout. 

Asarah!

She'd be fine, Boltac told himself. A strong woman, used to dealing with unruly customers. She had come through raids before. She'd be fine. Dimsbury dismissed the remaining, still mounted Orc. As he rode north out of the square, Boltac got a good look at him. It's skin like tarnished copper armor. It's eyes cold and hard to the edge of lifelessness. 

With a crossbow in the crook of his right arm, not taking his eyes from the window, he eased back to the weapons rack and grabbed a double-headed axe without looking at it. He asked himself, "What are you doing?" The voice in his head answered You're not gonna do anything stupid. You're a merchant, not a hero. She'll be fine. You're no help to anybody dead. He placed the axe, head down, beneath the windowsill, next to the other crossbow. 

Across the square, he saw the two Orcs emerge from the Inn holding Asarah between them. She struggled against them and cursed. "Think she is still going to be okay?" he asked the voice in his head. It did not answer. Dimsbury turned to look at her and she spit on him. Dimsbury raised his hand and struck her across the face.  Asarah brought her head upright again and rolled her hair out of her face. Dimsbury stood with his back to Boltac's store, so he could not see his face. But whatever expression the unpleasant man wore, when Asarah saw it she started screaming.

Something broke inside of Boltac. Before he knew what he was doing, he had fired both crossbows and was charging out the door with the axe in hand. The first crossbow bolt took the Orc on the Asarah's left in the throat. The second hit the other Orc in the shoulder. 

Asarah screamed a plea and a question, "Boltac?"

But the Boltac she knew was no longer there. The rational, calculating, cunning merchant who stuck his neck out for nobody was not the same creature who lungs burned and heart pumped as his feet churned the dirt of the street. That Boltac was lifting the axe and imagining it cleaving Dimsbury from neck to breastbone. That Boltac didn't hear it coming until it was too late. 

If it had been a man on a horse riding him down, he would have heard him coming from a week away. But the pads of a wolf on the cobbles? He only realized his mistake when it was too late. The wolves fangs sank into his shoulder and lifted him from the ground at a dead run. "HORRRRRRRRRRRRRRK!" cried the triumphant orc. 

In pain and animal rage, Boltac slashed blindly with the axe. He felt the edge sink deep into the wolf's neck. He heard it grunt in pain. The pressure in his shoulder went away as the wolf let go. Wolf, Orc and Shopkeeper tumbled across the cobblestones and landed in heap. Somehow, Botac had kept his grip on the axe. 

In a haze, he say Asarah struggling with with Dimsbury. She was shouting, but the only thing Boltac could hear was the pounding of his own heart. He pulled himself from beneath the wolf, tried to stand and failed. His knee folded sideways underneath him. The pain from the second fall was worse than the first. Clutching the axe, he started to crawl.

Behind him, the Orc recovered his feet and his pike. He cocked his head sideways at this strange man crawling towards master. Then he lifted his weapon and went to finish him. 

"Hold!" commanded Dimsbury. The Orc stayed the final blow. 

"My, my, my, you are determined," said Dimsbury with an air of amusement that made Boltac hate him all the more. "You are something more than a merchant, I think," said the Wizard. Boltac said, "en-henh" and kept crawling. 

"Boltac, what are you doing?" asked Asarah. Boltac could not answer because he was fighting off a wave of pain. But still he crawled. He was oblivious to the pike above his head, and only aware of Dimsbury's expensive boots in front of him. He was going to cut the bastard's feet off and then see where it went from there. 

Dimsbury shook his head at the poor spectacle at his feet. A fat merchant, crawling to his death and leaving the hot stuff of life trailing out of bite wound on the cobbles behind him. How was it that his arm had not been completely severed? He turned to his prize, "Come my dear, let me take you away from all of this."

"Let me go!" she cried, "I must to tend my Inn."

"Ah, yes," said Dimsbury. He waved his hand without taking his eyes from her and the front of the Bent Eelpout was engulfed in flame. 

Asarah screamed again. 

"Please," said the Wizard, "there's no need to scream in my ear." To the Orc he said, "Finish him." He gripped Asarah around the waist and held her to him. Before she could even fight, he took flight and disappeared straight up into the night with her. 

Boltac reached after her and struggled to his knees. 

The Orc brought the butt end of his pike down on Boltac's back and knocked him to the ground. Boltac heard some of his ribs separate from his spine. He thought that was bad, until the orc kicked him in the ribs. His world went white with pain and he rolled over onto his back. 

This was it. The Orc spun the pike and touched him gently on the nose point. Then lifted it into the air for the coup de grace.

And then, in that final moment, Boltac discovered that he wasn't afraid. He wasn't even angry. His last thought was of Asarah, and he was sad. Sad that he would never get to see her again. Sad that he would never again get to play the game of cheating her out of a drink, or drive her mad with his haggling, or marvel at the way her hair would bounce and turn like a living thing as she worked her way through the common room of her inn.

At times like these, ordinary men try negotiating with death. Offering every promise, pledge and advantage they could think of in exchange for life. But Boltac was not an ordinary man. And certainly not an ordinary negotiator. At that moment he realized that his life alone was not worth negotiating for. If was to haggle with fate, it would not be for his life, it would not be for his store or his fortune -- Boltac was surprised to discover that, in the final accounting, those things were worth nothing to him. The only thing worth negotiating for was life, with *her*. Without her, he couldn't seem to come up with a reason to bother.   

As if in a dream, he saw two feet of steel emerge from the Orc's belly. The pike fell, not on Boltac's head, but next him on the muddy street. As the Orc's body fell away to the side, Boltac saw the FarmBoy standing there, brandishing the sword Boltac had given him. Boltac said, "That blade is a quality item," and then passed out. 


# Drinking a Healing Potion #

Relan was so terrified, he left the sword in the Orc. 

"Mister? Mister? What do I do."

"Henh?" said Boltac, wondering why he wasn't being left to die in peace. Then he realized that he wasn't dead yet, just in a tremendous amount of pain. "The store, get me to the store."

"Okay, I can do that."

"Good kid. I'm gonna pass out now." But as soon as the mule-strong farmboy started dragging him across the cobbles, the pain of his injuries brought him back to consciousness. "Ahhhhh, AHHHH!"

"Sorry," said Relan.

"Don't apologize. Just draAAAAAAAAAHag!" Boltac passed out from the pain of being jolted against the cobble.s

When Relan got Boltac into the store and propped him up against the counter, Boltac came around enough to say, "Take the keys. In the back, the chest on the left. Very important, only open the chest on the LEFT. Bring me the bottle."

"Which bottle?"

"The *only* bottle. And hurry up. I'm dyin' here!"

"The only bottle. Right"

Relan hurried to the back. Fear caused him to fumble with the lock. And drop the keys. He had never seen that much blood come from a person before. And that thing he had stabbed out there. What was that? He'd never really thought about it. He woke up and saw it about to kill the merchant. There was sword in his lap. There had been no time, he had just done what needed doing. 

He dropped the keys, again. He never thought it would be anything like this. They sure didn't sing about this part. What if more of them came? What if they could smell blood. What if they were coming to the shop right now. Had he shut the door? And if he had shut the door, did he remember to bar it. He was confused and his head really hurt. 


He managed to get the chest open. Inside found many leather bags filled with coins. Ye gods, how many coins were in here? Tucked in a corner, he found a small glass bottle with the stopper wired shut. It seemed very old and the edge of the bottle were painted gold filigree. Relan picked it up very carefully. Drop the keys all you want, he told himself, but don't drop this bottle. 

He carried it out to where Boltac sat propped up in a pool of his own blood against the counter. As he handed it to him, he heard a buzzing as if an angry hive of bees was close by and with it, the smell of burning wood. "Gods," Relan said, "Flaming bees!"

"Shut up, kid," Boltac said weakly, "It's magic. Undo the wire."

Relan did as he was asked. Boltac held the bottle in his left hand and took the cork out with his teeth. He spit it across the room. He raised the bottle in a toast and said, "Listen, kid, if I don't make it. All thisâ€¦" he indicated the store he had worked so hard to build, "You don't take a single thing you understand? I wanna be buried with it."

Up until that point, Relan hadn't thought of stealing. It wasn't what heroes did, so it wasn't what Relan would do. 

Boltac but the bottle do his lips and drank. Then he screamed in pain. His back arched at a frightful angle. There was a cruel snapping and popping noise as his knee twisted back into place. Sweat poured from him face as he spiked a fever and broke it in less than a minute. A wave of nausea came, and then a sense of calm. The ragged wound in his shoulder spit out a tooth and closed. 

"Wh-wh-wh-what was that?" Relan asked in amazement. 

"That," Boltac said, the snap returning to his voice, "was a *magic* potion. The genuine article. Most of what I sell is herbs and healing tonics, a couple of smelly poultices made by this old crone out in one of the villages. I won't say they're garbage, but, uh, you slapping poultice on serious wound. Ya gonna die."

"Do you have any more?" Relan asked with wide eyes. Thinking that carrying a few of those potions with him would be an antidote to the fear that was still causing his limbs to shake. 

"Ah, no. Very rare. Very expensive. Help me up."

Boltac tried his recently mangled leg. It felt good. In fact, it felt better than he could remember it ever feeling. 

"Are you okay?" asked the FarmBoy.

"En-henh."

"What are you going to do?"

"What am I going to do?" Boltac thought hard. Set his jaw, narrowed his eyes and then fell dead asleep. 



# Goes to Duke #

When Boltac awoke, he was in his bed. Bright light streamed in through the window and he came back to consciousness slowly and from a great distance. At first he couldn't remember how he had gotten here, or what had happened. Then, as the memory of it flooded back, he became fearful. Unable to tell what might be fantastic dream from terrible reality, he flung back the covers. His leg was straight. His shirt was ripped, but the skin underneath was perfect and unscarred. That potion was magic. 

He got out of bed and stretched. Then he went downstairs. 

At the foot of the narrow stairs, he found Relan asleep in a pile of cloaks. Even in his sleep he clutching the sword the Boltac had given him. Boltac nudged him with his boot and jumped back.

"Ahh!" Relan awoke with a jerk. When he saw Boltac above him on the stairs he said, "I was standing guard. In case those things came back."

"No kid, that's sleeping guard," Boltac softened a little, "But, uh, I appreciate it." Boltac stepped over the boy and brought out a loaf thick black bread and some butter. "C'mon, breakfast."

They ate in silence for a while. Relan asked, "What were those things?" 

"Evidently, what you killed was an Orc."

"An Orc?"

"An Orc," Boltac said with a shrug, to indicate that he certainly wasn't the guy making the rules. 

"So they were bad," said Relan.

"Yeah, kid, they were definitely bad."

"So, are we going to go get them?"

"We? No. I'm not going to go get them? That's why I pay taxes."

"But that Evil Wizard took the woman you love?"

"Love is a strong word to use, for a pleasant association. Besides, I'm a merchant, not a fighter."

"If you're not in love with her, then why did you charge out of your store to save her?"

"I, uh, hey, look, it's complicated. 

"And for a somebody who's not a fighter, you managed to kill two Orcs."

"And a wolf," said Boltac, shaking his head. 

"That's pretty good."

"That's only because you suck," snapped Boltac. 

"Suck or not, I'm going after that Wizard. Somebody has to do the right thing."

"Kid, the right thing to do is almost always to keep your head down and make a buck."

"That sounds like something a coward would say."

"Eh-henh. It's the kind of thing the living says. Get this, I was very stupid. And am lucky to be alive. So I'm not going to push my luck. Besides, this kind of thing is why I pay taxes. Let the guards deal with this."

"You're a coward," said Relan.

"Whattya want from me? I'm a merchant. I ain't no hero." 

"Well why would anybody want to be that?" asked Relan, "If the whole world was merchants, nobody would have saved your life."

"Look, I'm grateful for that. Take what you like from the store, and then go to your death. Me, I'm going to see the Duke and see what he's gonna do about all this. See if he can get my Innkeeper lady friend back."

Relan just shook his head and took another bite of bread.

 

* * * 


Outside, smoke hung thick in the air. Everywhere there were signs of carnage, The Bent Eelpout and most of the other side of the street had burnt to the ground. Boltac saw the dead wolf and orcs, but did not linger over them. 

On the walk North, he passed serval bodies body lying in the street. One was a young girl, maybe nine. Her pretty dress was torn and soaked with blood. Boltac looked away and muttered, "Bad for business."

As he crossed the bridge to the keep, he expected to see a line of petitioners. But there was no one. Not even a guard at the gate. The court should be full with angry citizens demanding redress and protection. The walls should have been decorated with Orc's heads on Pikes. By now he should have been able to hear wounded members of the Ducal guard drinking by the stables. Their laughter and the stories of their bravery should have carried over the wall. There should have been smoke from the blacksmith, and the sound of weapons being sharpened. 

But there was nothing. 

In the courtyard he passed the royal carriage standing all alone. It looked like someone had abandoned it in haste. From the stable he heard the whinny of a horse. 

Boltac pushed his way into the keep through the half-opened front door. There was no one in the antechamber. There was no one anywhere. Every room he checked was empty. As if all the people had vanished. He called out, but only the echo of his own hello answered. 

When he reached the empty throne room. The penny dropped. Mostly, it was the tapestry flapping in a wind that shouldn't be there. Behind the heavy, musty, overly stylized scene of a heroic battle that had probably never happened, Boltac found a secret door. As he descend through the stone passageways the cold and the damp increased. He emerged at a set of docks in a high walled cove on the north side of the island. All the boats were gone, but discarded items were everywhere. Over there was a guard's helmet and at his feet was chest of silks. He could almost see the scene as it had happened. 

"A guard rushing to herd the Duke's household onto the boats. To get them down the River Swift before the attack came. A lady-in-waiting trying to bringing this ridiculous chest of frippery. "No, woman, we don't have room for your damn silks, the guard had snapped, perhaps knocking the chest from her hands as he shoved her roughly into a boat. 

Then he would jump in himself, pushing free of the docks. The water would have taken them South quickly and if they survived the an uncomfortable ride through the rapids, they would already be out of the grey, misted covered mountains of Robrecht and enjoying a leisurely ride to Shatnapur, the Northernmost city in the Southern Kingdoms. Odds are they were free and clear, floating down a river with the sun in their faces. 

Boltac spit in the river, then headed headed back up the stairs. 

As he trudged upward, he tried to wrap his head around it. At the first sign of danger, the Duke had fled. He looked around the great hall for a long time. Then he sat himself on the throne. For a second, he almost took it seriously. Then he laughed at himself. 

This chair wasn't for him. He was a merchant. Everyone knew you couldn't buy a throne. Sure, it could be inherited. But somewhere, some way, somebody had to win a throne with a sword. A sword drenched in blood. An illiterate barbarian could sooner be a King than a fat merchant. And it had been so long since Robrecht had a real King. Or anything other than a figurehead installed by a larger, more powerful Kingdom seeking to control the trade routes. 

The health of Kingdoms, thought Boltac, did not depend on war, but commerce. The opportunity for everyone to be able to conduct their business in peace every day is what made people happy and productive. But the only people deemed fit to rule were warriors and their inbred descendants. Something was wrong with this logic.

Boltac heaved himself off the fancy chair and left the room. From the wall of the castle he could see heavy columns of smoke rising from the north side of the town. In two's and three's people were leaving from the North gate. To the south, the damage was less, but there was a larger stream of traffic. People were leaving? Was this the way it was to be? Was this how his town died? 

By the time he got back to the store, Relan was gone. Boltac's practiced shopkeeper's eye quickly saw what the boy had taken. All the wrong things. The idiot was probably walking. Walking to his heroic death. 

Boltac thought about opening for business. He thought about barricading the store against looters. Then he looked across the street to the still smoldering remnants of the Bent Eelpout. He stared for a long time. He stared until a light rain began to fall. The drops turned to steam as soon as the hit the coals. Each drop was infinitesimal. Wasted. A single drop could not put out a fire. But enough water could wash an entire city away.  He savored his melancholy and rolled this thought around for a while. Then he turned his back on the window.  

Boltac began to gather the finest items, from the most secret places in his store.

>add a list of items
>squeezing into elven mail
>firefly lantern
>Mace in a case.
>

Yes, it was stupid. But there was nothing else to do. In the end, he had no more choice than a single raindrop. It had been a mistake to try fight like a hero. Boltac could see that now. He wasn't a hero. He wasn't a King. But he wasn't powerless. He could use the skills and tools he had rather than go off half-cocked. He could do a better job of outfitting himself. And he would be damned if he would be *walking* to his death. 

> "I'll protect you!"
> "That's not what you're here for. You're here to carry the lantern"

# Rattick, back at the Dungeon #

Like all survivors, Rattick had found a way to profit from the sack of Robrecht. At the first signs of the assault, he had fled to the alleys. And then into the sewers. And then, by means of one of the secret ways that well-known to the darker and more desperate sort, made his way out into the wilderness again. 

He stayed to the woods alongside the road, spending the night in a tree. Early in the morning he was awakened by the raiding party leaving Robrecht. Those horrible things on wolves, crying "Hork, Hork, Hork!" as they rode the unlit roads. He wondered what treasure they had taken from Robrecht. Probably just people for food. But just in case, he followed their tracks, looking for dropped baubles by the light of morning. 

It was bad news for Robrecht, but good news for Rattick. When word got out about the sack of Robrecht, adventurers would come from all parts of the Four Kingdoms. Seeking glory, seeking loot. His grift was about to go big time. Maybe he needed a partner to handle the additional volume. 


Traveling carefully, it took Rattick three days to return to the entrance of the Wizard's lair. The door and the hillside containing it had been removed, as if a giant had scooped it away and thrown it over a mountain. The wolf tracks led directly into the gaping maw. 

Ah, thought Rattick, so the wizard was upping his game. That was good. A unified villain made for a better story. It would draw more powerful adventurers. And more powerful adventurers would have more expensive gear and weapons. 

Rattick settled in to wait at the entrance to the Wizard's lair. As he waited, he invented a new line of patter about love and life lost in the fall of Robrecht. 

Tell them how he was there for vengeance, but realized to attempt the depths of the fiendish dungeon alone would be surest suicide. He would promise to serve his new friends faithfully

And, then, of course, feed them to the Troll steal all their things and bury them in the woods. 

>Of course it would have been more comfortable to lounge in an Inn and pick his marks that way, lying in waite


Before he got too deep into his fantasy, he was interrupted by the sound of a carriage making it's way over the rutted forest road. A CARRIAGE! thought Rattick. There was *real* wealth. Adventurer's walked or rode horses. But a party adventurer's in a carriage. That meant real coin!

The carriage rolled to a halt in front of what was left of the mine entrance.

He had his speech all ready. Please, brave companions, let me join you. I come seeking revenge for the death of my father, two villages over. I will carry your equipage, fight like a cornered wolverine, do anything that you ask of me -- but I must defeat the scourge that is on this land. 

When out from the carriage stepped, Boltac?



# Kid Hears the Wagon. #


For Relan, Adventure was pretty much the same as sore feet. He had been following wolf tracks North for the btter part of a jaywalking North for the better part of a day. 


Boltac rides up and says, "Climb on, idiot."

"Where are you going?"

"You want to be the big hero? Save the girl, win the kingdom, all that?"

"Yes,"

"Well that's where I'm going."

"I warn you, you'll probably be killed."

"Me? But I'm young and strong. You're old and fat."

"Age and cunning will always beat youth and enthusiasm. You comin' or not?"

The kid still didn't climb onto the carriage. "What changed your mind. Don't you pay taxes."

"The Duke ran away. Took his guards with him."

The kids mouth dropped open. He lost the power of speech.

"Can he do that?"

"Age and cunning kid. So it's just us. Ain't nobody else."

The farm boy climbed up the wagon and they road off. 

{Kid picked a helmet that was too big, just because he thought it looked cool} 

"Y'know, I'm not afraid now."

"You should be," said Boltac, "We're going to do something very dangerous and stupid."

"It's not. We've got to rescue the girl."

"Yeah, but what's in it for you."

"Well," he said, "I'll get to make a name for myself. Be somebody. Maybe get a girl of my own."

"We're going to get killed."

"Not if you brought any more of those healing potions. I mean that was cool. I've never seen anything like that. I didn't even know--"

"Kid, I didn't bring any more potions. Not like that."

"Well, why not."

"Because that was the only one I had. Magic, real magic is very expensive. And it's tricky. If you're plan depends on magic, it's probably not gonna work."

"It was cool though."

"Yeah, I'm probably growing an extra liver though. Or an extra lung in the middle of my stomach."

"It worked out."

"Yeah, but next time, ennnh," Boltac waggled his palm from side to side.  "Magic is a bad bet."

"So what did you bring?" Relan asked, looking at the bags on top of the coach. 

"A little of this, a little of that, and a shitload of coin."

"Why money?"

"Why money? WHY MONEY? Are you serious?"

"Yeah, there's not going to be anything to buy."

"Are you kidding there's gonna be all kind of things to buy. Not the least of which is the woman I want to get back."

"Wait, I thought this was a daring rescue?"

"No, it's just a rescue. If possible, I'd like to keep the *daring* to a minimum."

"But how am I supposed to make a name for myself?"

"Easy, you lie."

"Lie? A true hero would never do that."

"Okay, how many heroes do you know kid?"

"Well there's Uthgar, and Frowen and C'huhoyle."

"Not from sagas. Not dead guys you heard about in a song someplace. I mean, how many honest to gods heroes do you know. Have had a beer with?"

"Uhâ€¦"

"Take your time. Make sure you count them all," Boltac said as he let the soothing clip clop of the horses hooves and the tranquil beauty of the forest lull him into something of a trance. Boltac knew he was probably going get himself killed with a stunt like this. But right now that just made him wish that he had spent a little bit more time outside of the store.  

"None," interrupted Relan. 

"Did you miss any? I mean is that an exact count? Because, as a merchant, I can tell you, it is important to be precise with figures."

"Okay, okay, you've made your point."

"Yeah, that's what I thought. There are two possible reasons for this, and pay attention, because they are closely linked. One, everybody who sets out to be a hero gets killed. And Two, there's no such thing as heroes."

"That's not true. That't can't be true. Why there's got to be heroes. Who else looks out for the poor and the unfortunate?"

"The poor and the unfortunate either look out for themselves, or, well, they don't have that problem anymore."

"That's terrible. That's the most awful thing I've ever heard."

Boltac shrugged, "Hey, these a dark ages that we live in. I don't make the rules. I don't even like the rules."

"The rules suck. And I think you have it wrong."

"I wish I did," said Boltac, "but there's nothing either of us can do to change it."

They rode on in silence.


(( Kid, do you know why people fight wars?

To win?

"No, nobody wins in a war, except the guy selling swords and armor. No people fight wars to put themselves in a better negotiating position."

"Not for love, or honor or a righteous cause?"

"Not in my experience."

"But in the songs."

"Kid, they're songs. *Songs.* As in, not real."

"They're real to me."

"En-henh. And that's great, but the point here is fighting is stupid, negotiation is power."

"I don't think --"

"Yeah, I figured that one out already. Just trust me, if we can bribe our way through this thing, everybody will be a lot happier. And a lot more alive.

"Hey kid, you mind taking the reins for a while? I'm still a little woozy from that potion."

"Woozy, but it was magic."

"Trust me, the hangover you get from magic is the worst kind of hangover there is."

# Rattick in Front of the Dungeon #

>there's another version of this in the old drafts -- see if the intro paragraph is better. 

Rattick was no hero. At the first sign of trouble, he had slunk into the alleys of Robrecht. As strange creatures marauded through the town and fire ravaged the buildings, slunk through the shadows, looting corpses where he could, burgling a store or two, until he reached the South gate. He found a horse in the Guard's stable and was gone into the night. 

He rode hard around the city, eventually picking up the tracks of the giant wolves' retreat. He followed them, as a vulture would, hoping to find some profit off of any they might kill or savage on their ride. But  he was disappointed. The tracks led back to the Wizard's lair in the woods. The least they could have done was sacked a village upon the way. Or a mule train loaded with valuables. Really, how was a vulture like Rattick supposed to make a living. 

When Rattick reached the dungeon entrance, it wasn't there anymore. Where once had been a grassy hill and innocuous looking wooden door was now a smoking hole in the earth. 

He saw where the wolf tracks led directly over the edge and into the maw of the pit. Hmm, so the Wizard had become fed up. As he rode carefully around the perimeter of the clearing he imagined the scene in his mind. Often enough he had heard the howls of frustration echoing through lower dark of the dungeon. Often had he spied on the man from the safety of the shadows. Rattick was amazed and frightened by the mighty magics he saw the man work. But for one so wise in the ways of power to be so ignorant of patience. Even now he chuckled. 

Did someone make it past the Troll? Rattick shouldn't wonder. He had been keeping the creature so well fed, half the time he guided adventurers to him he had to be sure to wake the beast.

Yes, the Wizard, standing in a cavern surrounded by things grown not made, fearsome Orcs on trained wolf mounts. The Wizard ranting incoherently, raging against insults and injuries both real and imagined. He throws up his hands, says a word of power and an entire hillside blows outward into the night. 

With a hue and cry, the Orc's of War are let slip. 

It was the kind of scene that one would place in a mighty saga to give the Hero time to rally an army and save the town. Except that there was no hero. And there was no army. Just a wound in the earth and an unsuspecting town that had been sacked.

And best of all for Rattick, all of this only served to make things better. Powerful the Wizard might be, but he was ignorant of the ways of man. Now that he had sacked the town of Robrecht, even more heroes would come seeking to defeat him and steal his treasure.  

He had proven himself a more powerful wizard and now would lure more  and more powerful adventurers. And all of these would-be heroes would bring more valuables with them. Which was good for Rattick. When the next party came, he would spin his sad tale of love and life lost in the fall of Robrecht. 

He would summon tears to his false eyes and tell how he had come for vengeance, but realized to attempt the depths of the fiendish dungeon alone would be surest suicide. He would promise to serve his new friends faithfully. And when they fell, profit. 

He hobbled his horse and left it to forage. Then he climbed into a tree, found a comfortable limb and waited peacefully for the next flock of heroic lambs to come to the slaughter.

His dreams of blood and fortune were soon interrupted by the sound of horses and, was that a wagon? Coming up the forest road.  

He peered down through the leaves and spied a coach fit for a king. Or a  party of adventurers so rich that Rattick would only have to run his bloody con one last time before he retired to the warmth and debauchery of the Southern Kingdoms. 

He clambered down from the tree to quickly, he nearly fell and broke his leg. He rushed to greet the adventurers, noting that the strong-jawed blond lad who drove the carriage was wearing a very high grade of armor. A very good sign, thought Rattick, expensive armor, even on the servants.

"Hello, hail and welcome, proud adventurers. Be on your guard, for you have come to the lair of a Wizard most foul and dangerous. Humble as I am, I place at your service, my unworthy person, Rattick." He said, finishing with a low bow. 


Before he raised his head, he heard a familiar and irritating voice say, "Ah, Rattick, do I have a deal for you!"

He looked up sharply. "BOLTAC?!?"


> Relan has a pack and rope. Boltac has a tiny little sack, and a scale hanging off of his belt? (bag of holding.)
			


## Boltac Hires Rattick ##


"Rattick!" answered Boltac, not missing a beat, "Is it ever your lucky day."

"Why?" asked Rattick with narrowing eyes. 

"Have I got a deal for you."

"I think you are a long way from your store, shrewd merchant."

"And don't I know it. Relan, unload the bags, while I have a word with Rattick here."

"Who's he?" Rattick asked, nodding at the kid. 

"Him? Oh, he's the hero."

"If he's the hero, then what does that make you?"

"The cunning fat guy who outsmarts everybody in the end."

"I don't understand."

"Rattick, I want to hire you. Now before you protest, here's 10 gold pieces. Now there's more where that came from. Plenty more. I seek an audience with the Wizard at the bottom of this smoking hole, and I want you to get me there."

"Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ have you lost your mind, fat merchant?"

"Because I'm here, yes. But I haven't lost all my cunning, you understand. Half you reward is with me, half when you get me back to town."

"Twenty gold pieces is not enough."

"I know that Rattick. I do. That was just to get your attention."

"I don't know if Iâ€¦"

"Of course you can. What's that smell?"

"Troll."

"There's a Troll?" asked Relan, as he lowered he brown sack from the, "Why is this so heavy?"

"It's not heavy," Boltac said, taking it from him, "You're just not used to work. And there's a troll somewhere inside this hole. It's the same Troll he's been using to kill hapless adventurers, just like us. Isn't that right Rattick?"

"I would never do such a thing. I am here to avenge my beloved Robrecht. And I for one am shocked, SHOCKED --"

"Yadda, yadda, yadda. See kid, what he did, nevermind kid, what he did was despicable. But the important thing is that we're not going to fall for it."

"No we're not," said the FarmBoy, not knowing what he wasn't going to fall for, but scaring Rattick a little anyway."

"What are you going to do with me?" asked Rattick. 

"Do with you. Why I'm going to make you rich. Name a figure Rattick. How many coins do you need to guide me to the Wizard at the bottom of this smoking hole in the Earth."

"Why do you want to see him so badly?"

"He has a friend of mine. And I'd like her back."

"Ho, ho ho. Is this love? Love from the man who is all business."

"Yeah, I'm all business Rattick, so how much you want."

"I can't get you past the Troll."

"What do you mean, Rattick. Sneaky little weasel like you?"

"No, no, I swear it. Ever since he put the Troll there, even I haven't been able to sneak to the lower levels. Trolls have a very good sense of smell."

"Nah Rattick, you're just rotten to the core. But don't you worry about that. You get me to the Troll, and I'll take care of him."

"What? YOU? You can't be serious," Rattick collapsed in laughter.

"Rattick, I'm your boss. You shouldn't mock your boss."

"You're not my boss. I would never work for a man who would get me killed."

"Ah, so little faith Rattick. I tell you what." Boltac pulled a full coin purse from my belt. "This is for you. And three times this much when we get back to Robrecht with the girl."

"Even with my help, you don't stand a chance," said Rattick. 

"Don't forget about me," said Relan drawing his sword. The conversation came to a complete halt as both men stared at the Farm boy. In fact, they stared so long, the boy became uncomfortable and asked, "What."

"But that away before you hurt yourself," said Boltac. "Now where were we."

"You were just about to get yourself killed," said Rattick. 

"Ah yes, exactly, ye of little faith. I tell you what Rattick. You lead me to the Troll, and if I can't defeat the Troll, you keep the gold. I mean after the Troll eats me and shits it out."

"Trolls shit gold?" asked Relan, very confused. 

"Gold is very hard to digest. Isn't that right Rattick?"

"Shut up and follow me," said Rattick. 



"Name a figure Rattick. How many coins you want to guide me to the bottom of this smoking whole in the Earth?"

Because I haven't brought all the gold with me, "

Now it was Rattick's turn to say, "En-henh," Boltac didn't like the sound of his own skepticism coming back at him. "I can get you *to* the Troll, stout merchant, but I cannot get you *past* the troll."

"Then lead on McSneaky, I'll handle your Troll."

"I shall look forward to serving you, then going through your pockets for loose change."

"En-henh," said Boltac, "C'mon Relan, time to go."

"Are the horse going to be okay if we leave them out here?" asked the  lad with real concern.

"Henh, he's worried about the horses."  

# Boltac Versus the Troll #

"Shhh," said Rattick. "It's right up ahead. Now, if you're going to stand any kind of a chance at all, you need to take your dagger. Wait, where's your dagger?"

"Nah, I got different idea."

"But maybe he is right," said Relan, as he began to unsheathe his sword. 

"Keep it in your pants kid," snapped Boltac. "Look, both of yas, we'll try it my way first and if it doesn't work."

"I will avenge you," said Relan.

"Me too," said Rattick, oozing with sarcasm.

"Enh-henh. Ye of little faith."

Then he turned and lifted his lantern high. He strode out of the darkness into the chamber, right up to the foot of the sleeping troll and said, "Oh Mister Trooooooo-ll. Wakey, wakey! You're Uncle Boltac has got a deal for you."

# Boltac v troll other #

As they defended into the darkness, Rattick thought about knifing them both then and there. They wouldn't be expecting it.  It would be a quick, certain profit. No chance of Boltac getting him killed. But no sooner had the thought crossed his mind than Boltac said, "I know what you're thinking Rattick. Why don't I knife these two right now and go through their pockets for loose change."

"That's not *exactly* what I'm thinking."

"Yeah, but close enough. And you want to know what I'm thinking about? Other than your inevitable and predictable betrayal." Rattick was silent. Boltac continued, "I'm thinking, if you're our guide, you should be going first. Kid, give this slippery bastard the lantern."

"But I'm one of your key suppliers!" protested Rattick 

"He might steal your wondrous lantern," protested Relan. 

"That's okay," said Boltac, "if he stole it from me, he'd have nobody else to sell it back to. But if he makes you nervous, poke him with your sword a little bit. Don't kill him, just make him leak."

"Shh," said Rattick.

"Shh yourself, you crooked bastard," said Boltac.

"What's that noise," asked Relan? Everyone fell silent and realized that each step was taking them closer towards a truly horrible rumbling noise. 

The noise was intermitent. There was a rumbling that sounded like someone with a gigantic set of lungs filled with gravel trying to exhale without coughing. Then silence. Then that same, horrible, ingeopulmonary rumble. 

"Troll," said Rattick.

"Doing what," asked Relan. 

Rattick waited until the sound had rumbled through the corridor again. They were close enough that the sound had become truly deafening.

"Snoring," whispered Rattick into the sudden silence. "Which is a good thing for you, stout Merchant. What I suggest is that you keep to the shadows. Advance while it's snoring. Then you take your dagger and stick it right in his ear. It's really the only vulnerable place on the hole Troll."

"I don't have a dagger," said Boltac.

"You can use my sword," offered Relan. 

"That's nice of you kid. 'Cause after all it's my sword. But I'm not going to need it."

"What are you going to do?"

In the blue cast of the flickering fairy lantern, Boltac took a pair of heavy wool gloves from his belt and put them on. "I'm gonna do what I do best. I'm going to make a deal with him."

Relan searched his memories for sagas in which the hero had defeated the monster by making a deal. He came up empty. 

Rattick asked, "Stout Merchant, have you ever seen a troll?" 


# From Troll's perspective #



The Troll was asleep next to a mount of phosphorescent lichen. Strictly speaking, the creature didn't need light to see, and it hated sunlight, but the presence of sleight illumination allowed the stroll to see the terror on his meals faces more clearly. As the old troll proverb goes (it doesn't translate well) food better frightened, or scared is good eaten' or terror is the best sauce. 

But when the troll woke up, because something was kicking him in the foot. This was a decidedly strange sensation for the Troll. There really isn't anything in a Troll's native habitat that has the temerity to kick a troll. In the dim light of the dungeon he saw food, holding a bag and looking at him. 

"Yoo hoo, Mister Troooooooll. Have I got a deal for you," said the food. 

Wait, food was talking. This was confusing. Food never talked. Sometimes food screamed. Sometimes food tried to poke the Troll with sharp things. Most of the time food ran away. But it never stood it's ground and talked. Since the Troll couldn't understand *what* any of the funny, squeaky words that were coming out of it's mouth, it tried to understand *why* food wasn't doing any of the things that it usually did. 

Maybe it was poisoned? That thought disturbed the Troll. Since he often ate people without bothering to peel them, his stomach was a cause of constant trouble. And, for reasons he couldn't understand, he had been eating quite well lately. Food had been easier a lot easier to come by since he had come to this cave. He didn't even have to go out and terrorize the countryside. And how had he gotten to this cave? He couldn't quite remember that part. 

The Troll decided that he had thought enough for one day, and drew himself up to his full height. He let out a little good morning yawn (a Troll yawn is more like a roar) that rattled a few chips of rock of the ceiling. He expected to see food running away, or curled up in a convenient, bite-sized ball of fear, but it was still there.

"There we go," said Boltac, "Come get a closer look at the merchandize." 

From the shadows, Relan drew in breath sharply and said, "He's dead."

A darker, more obscure, yet somewhat Rattick-shaped shadow next to him said, "You are not as dumb as you look, kid,"

"Thank --" Relan began. But a finger pressed to his lips and silenced him. 

"Shhh. Don't ruin it. I'm going to enjoy this."

The Troll lowered his head and made two whuffing grunts. This expulsion of air freed his tusks from the ponderous folds of his cheeks and filled the enclosed space with the foul stench of troll breath. He stepped forward to begin his charge. 

"Here," said Boltac, "Try this." From within his sack of holding, Boltac produced a glittering silver mace. The head was encrusted with jewels that that glittered in the uncertain light of the dungeon. The whole thing was so large that it was more decorative club than mace proper. He held it out to the Troll and said, "Just try it, see how you like the heft."

The Troll, not being smart enough to fear a shrewd merchant's smile -- and generally not knowing what the hell was going on -- took the relatively tiny mace in it's absolutely gigantic hand. 

"There," said Boltac, and he released the mace. No sooner had he let go of the bejeweled head of the mace than the Troll collapsed to the rough stone floor as if it had been smashed there by the hand of an angry God. 



# Aftermath of Troll #

Pinned to the floor, the Troll looked much less fierce now. His eyes were wide, and shifting fearfully as he whimpered a little. His foul claw remained tightly wrapped around the silver mace. 

"What is that?" asked Rattick.

"That is a very cursed Mace of Encumbrance," said Boltac removing his gloves. 

"Magic," whispered Relan. 

"Yeah, kid, that's magic for you, there's always a catch."

"Like dealing with you," said Rattick with newfound respect. 

"Hey, I didn't force him to do anything. Here you go Mr. Troll. Here's a free mace. He took it."

"But the Troll didn't knowâ€¦" said Relan.

"That's there's no such thing as a free mace? Yeah, that's how they get you. Everybody knows this. And that's especially how they get you with magic."

"But what about Wizards? They use magic," countered Rattick. 

"They always manage to do themselves in in the end. Just 'cause you get away with something for a while doesn't make it safe."

Rattick said, "Marveled as I am by your cunning, good merchant, one question remains: How did you learn about the mace?"

"A guy brought it in a carrying case and refused to take it out.   I thought maybe I could get the jewels off, but the enchantment was too powerful. My last apprentice was pinned to the floor in my shop for a week before we figured out how to get him out from the grip of that foul thing."

""How did you manage it?" asked Rattick

"Ahhhh," said Boltac, raising a finger to the side of his nose. "That would be telling." The smile faded from his face as he added, "My advice to both of you? Stay outta the magic bag."

"No problem," said Relan. 

"Problem," thought Rattick. He didn't know what could possibly be in Boltac's magic bag, but he thought that the bag itself could be worth more than he could imagine. And Rattick had quite an imagination.  

"C'mon, I don't want to be all day getting my lady friend back," said Boltac as he headed into the darkness. "How deep do you think this goes anyway?"

All the way to the bottom, though rat tick

>Kid worried that the magic lantern comes with a catch. 

# The Wizard Hated Administration

The Wizard hated Administration. He hated arithmetic. He hated planning. Some days, he wondered if he had any talent for anything other than magic at all. 

He could create a monster and control it easily enough. But, little by little, inadvertently, and without realizing it until it was too late, Alston Dimsbury had created the worst kind of monster of all. An organization. 

He looked up from the ledgers and rubbed his eyes. Gah, supplies, inventories, requisitions. Some 2000 orcs and wolves required feeding and clothing and organizing. It was all so tedious. But he needed an army. An army and an army of smarter orcs to run it. 

Intelligence is a dangerous thing to breed into a creature. You never know which way it would go. Alston had discovered this the hard way. Too much intelligence, too much initiative and your creations would be too hard to command. Or, at worst, they would turn rebellious. Too little intelligence and they would be useless. Sometimes dying because they forgot to breathe. 

In all his experiments with Orcs (his own name, he was quite proud of it), growing various strains and cultivars, he had many, many failures and only one success in creating the perfect mix between intelligence and servility. 

As a reward, Alston had given this Orc it's own name, and made it overseer over all the other Orc. It name was Samga. And he was the Wizard's right-hand, well, Orc. Samga's duties were wide and varied, but right now, Samga was approaching with a covered tray. 

"Ah, lunch," said the Wizard with a smile. A reprieve from paperwork at last. Samga smiled, or as close to is an Orc could manage and set the tray down.

When the Wizard lifted the cover, he found a bloody, unappetizing mess. On the plate before him it he could make out two slices of bread, some lettuce, two slices of tomato and lot of bloody meat. The Wizard replaced the cover gently and asked, "What is this?"

"It's an M.L.T.," grunted Samga with all the manners and polite inflection he could muster. "Man, Lettuce and Tomato samwich."

"And what is that?" asked Dimsbury.

"Well, it's man. Lettuce. and Tomato innit?" seeing the foul look brewing on the Wizard's already foul-looking face, Samga changed directions, "o' course, the finest sliced leg of Man."

"Raw leg of man, I assume?"

"Oh, of course my master. Only the finest for you."

The Wizard replaced the cover on the vile lunch-like creation that sat before him. "And the leg of Man is, I am to understand, uncooked?"

"Oh of course, my -- oh, I see what you're getting at. It's just that Orc's don't, you know, cook meat, so the cooks don't, uh" Samga seemed genuinely hurt and flustered. 
 
"There, there Samga. You kind was not bred for cuisine, I understand. Simply take it away and bring me the female prisoner."

"You want us to cook her then?"

"No! No! Samga, I have other uses for her. Please bring her too me unharmed."

"Oh, all right," Samga said with obvious disappointment. He hunched over the tray  and started shuffling out of the room. 

"Here, Samga, what's wrong now?"

"Nothing my lord. It's just, she looks *delicious*."

"Yes, Samga, she certainly does."


# From Asarah's POV #

When the wizard had flown off with her, Asarah had managed to scream for all of twenty seconds before she passed out. When she awoke, she found herself unharmed on a cell of damp grey rock. There was no window and no furniture. 

Next to the pile of straw she was lying on there was a candle in a pile of wax that burned in defiance of the oppressive dark of the place. She got up and took the candle. The only way in and our of the room was a heavy oak door with a small window. 

Through the window she could see that the hallway seemed to be carved out of the same living rock as the cell. She listen carefully, but heard nothing. When she moved the candle away from the window, she thought she could see the merest him of a flicker of light from the right. 

"Hey!" she yelled. No response.

"You out there! I know you're out there. You can't have a jail without a jailer!" She heard the scraping of a chair against the stone floor. "Come here! I need to see you. I demand to see you."

The shuffling, snuffling noise moved down the hallway towards her, but there was no light? What manner man could see in the dark. She held the candle out

A face of grey-green, leathery skin, punctuated by tusks and beady black eyes eyes came at her from out of the darkness. It snarled and Asarah jumped backwards dropping her candle. The candle sputtered and went out before she could pick it up again. 

There, in the terrible darkness, she heard a sob and realized how afraid she truly was. She could hear the thing breathing on the other side of the door. She prayed she wouldn't hear the sound of the door opening. 

After an eternity, the thing grunted, and walked back down the hallway. Asarah did not cry out again. 

She felt her way back to the straw and curled up in a ball. This was awful. This was worse than anything she ever could have imagined. To be in a cell was one thing. But to be trapped in a cell because you were afraid to even escapeâ€¦

After what felt like an eternity of terror in the darkness, she heard steps coming down the hallway. And this time light came with them. In spite of herself, her hopes rose. Perhaps this would be a person --  A human being -- rather than that awful thing she had just been subjected to. She looked to the faint glimmer of light that came through the doorway, but she did not rush to the window. 

Another of those strange, monstrous faces thrust itself into the window, but instead of grunting or snarling, this one spoke a soft, strangely accented English. 

"Pardon, my lady, but the master would like to see you know."

"The Master?" asked Asarah, reassured by the creatures manners and seemingly kindly demeanor. "Who is the master? For that matter, who are you? And what manner of hospitality is this?"

"I am Samga, my Lady. And the Master is, well, the Master, Maker of us all." Ah yes, now it made sense to Asarah. The man who took her into the air had abducted her for a reason, the oldest reason of all. Men, thought Asarah, no matter how rich or powerful they might be, they were all the same. 

"And what are you Samga?" Asarah asked as she rose to her feet. 

"I am an Orc?"

"An Orc? And what is that."

"I know not. None of us do. We are made not born, in the bowels of the Earth, to serve the Master."

Gah, what an existence, though Asarah. And she simply *hated* the word Bowels. The door to the cell creaked open and Samga entered. As she saw him in the full light of the lantern, he was less terrifying than she thought. It helped that he wasn't riding a wolf or sacking the town in which she lived. "So what does your master want with me," Asarah asked with a false pout. 

"It's not wise for me to ask, my Lady. We must go."

"Wait," said Asarah. ""I must look a fright. Your master will be unhappy if I do not have time to compose himself." 

"Master is usually unhappy," Samga said with a sad look that looked decidedly out of place on what was obviously a monster.  

Asarah knew what the flying man wanted with her she wasn't about to give it to him without a fight. But there were many ways to fight. And where a man had desire, a woman had an opportunity to torture. She took stock of her appearance as best she could without a mirror. Her hair, unruly at the best of times, was now an utterly out of control mess. That was okay, some men preferred her that way. Unless she missed her mark, this Wizard was one of them. But her dress? ugh. It simply wouldn't do. She smiled an evil smile and started ripping. 

After her first few tears, her left sleeve and blouse was in tatters, revealing the hollow of her clavicle, most of her left breast and all of her left arm. Then he grabbed a hold of the skirt below the knees. A few sharp jerks and she was showing a lot more leg. Then she rolled her lips inward and bit down on them hard to bring a bright redness to them. 

There, she thought, that ought to put him in a twist. Not all men are wizards, but all wizards are men. Asarah, girl, we're going to see how much we can lead this one around.  


She turned and tried it out on the creature. When she didn't even get the hint of a reaction, she asked, "What manner of man are you?"

"No man. Orc. The master is waiting."

Hunh, she thought, Orcs must be gay. 

She followed the creature's gray-green mottled skin out into the hallway. 



It was the loose sack

# Wizard vs. Asarah #




She thinks he wants her. He tells her she is the wrong class -- almost sub human. He tells her too cook lamb. 


-- Couldn't mate with you you are simply of an inferior class. An eagle trying to beget with a sparrow -- simply won't do. 
 Who are you trying to convince, she asked with a roll of her hips.




She talks to the Orcs

Wizard finds out about dead troll.

Tries to force her to cook. She refuses. Asserts her independence. 

She has to stage some kind of destabilizing thing. 

He kills one of his own creatures for talking back. 

* Wizard finds out about the Dead Troll. 
* Dispatches Orcs to find them. They use torches, they are separated, Rattick is discovered, 
* Rattick before the Wizard -- reveal that they are friends. he sets up Boltac. 
* Boltac and Relan hide from the Orc's -- have a bit of misadventure. 
* * where's Rattick -- who cares, we're pressing on. Which way? Down

>Wizard -- don't you see, your companion has betrayed you. 
>Boltac -- don't you see, that's the nice thing about making deals rather than fighting. He can't really betray me. I wanted to meet you and now I have. 
>Wizard -- And now you will die. 
>Boltac -- That might not be in your best advantage.

# Orc Brings bad news about Troll Being Dead.

He pointed at the Orc that had brought the news and hooked his fingers so that his hand formed a ragged, palsied, fist-like object.

The Orc writhed in pain as inside it's body it's bones were ground together by the unspeakable, sinister forces of the Wizard's evil magic.

When the Orc whimpered, Alston Dimsbury gave a tiny smile. Then the corners of his mouth dropped an he sucked air in between his teeth. 

As he did this, the Orc's skin tightened, causing the creatures eyes to bulge out. 

Asarah recoiled in terror from the Wizard's unspeakable cruelty. 

"Oh no my dear, you mustn't worry. They don't feel pain. Not really. Not any more than a machine or an animal does."

Wide-eyed and afraid of a power she did not understand, Asarah said nothing. She did not want have her bones crushed  

"Dispose of this one, Samga. It is defective."

Samga nodded once. With one arm, he reached down and removed the heavy wooden cover from the floor. Then, with a clawed foot, he kicked the crushed and gibbering Orc in to the blackness of the pit. Then he dragged the cover back into place. 

The Wizard said, "Creation is a messy business. One makes a great deal of mistakes you see. But thankfully, I have a very deep pit in which to bury my failures. "

>Asarah moved to the warm, yellowwood disc in the floor of the center of the room. Anything to get away from the awful, clammy damp of this dungeon. 

>Oh, I wouldn't stand there, my dear. I'm afraid that pit is rather bottomless. 

At first,  he had though

At first he was worried that the Troll might 

Samga is no fool. He knows to bring a scapegoat with him. 


>well send out patrols, catch them.
>They might get a bit killed the catching my Lud.
>Well, whatever's left, you must bring it to me. 




# Rattick Betrays Him #

# He Tries to Buy the Girl #

>Asarah doesn't want to admit weakness -- Boltac struggles with this -- "It's not weakness let someone love you", he said. 

So he goes into the dungeon. The woman tries to get him to leave -- You've come to fight for my Honor. I thought you were smarter than that!"

"No, I'm not here to fight for your honor. I'm here to buy you."

"BUY ME! What do you think I am, some kind of whore!"

"Keep your voice down," said Colbac, but by then it was too late. 

Monsters sprung up from all corners of the room. The menagerie scuffled and howled as their master rose from his couch and waved light into the room with a wizarding gesture. 

"What have we here? Why it is my fellow mutton lover. Tell me, what brings you to the depths of my lair."

Colbac could see no percentage in lying. He jerked a thumb at [THE INNKEEPER] and said, "Her."

"Oh really, is it true love?" asked Oddna with great relish. When they both blushed, he laughed. "Oh my, it _is_ true love. And I thought it was rarer than unicorns. But wait, no it can't be true love, because you told me you had no interest in her. Or don't you remember. I admit, I was in disguise, but I would think a sophisticated man of commerce, such as yourself, would remember."

"I said she wasn't my _____, that doesn't give you liscense to steal her."

"I don't care for being stolen, Roderick," said [the INNKEEPER]

"Roderick?" asked Colbac with a snicker, "Well no wonder you've turned evil in your dotage. Was it all those children who taunted you in school that turned your heart to evil?"

Oddna looked at him for a long time. Long enough for every creature in the room, except the strange, powerful wizard to grow uneasy. Mostly it was his smile. It seemed to grow and grow, stretch endlessly under those dead eyes. 

"Yes, you are right. I have stolen her, fair and square, and she is mine. And you have come to fight for her. Take you pick of the creatures you see here before you. You may fight any one of them for her hand. Then, if you win, you may fight the rest of them. And then, if you defeat all of them, you may do battle with me."

"No," began Colbac.

"No? What do you mean no? You have come here as an adventurer -- as the Hero -- to rescue the damsel in distress. You must fight? You must. That's how these things work."

"I'm not here for a fight. You stole her, fine, she is your property, but I thought perhaps we could make a a deal."

"BUY ME!" protested Sarah, "is that your idea of chivalry. Buying the woman you love back from..."

"I never said anything about Love or Chivalry," Colbac snapped in that way that you can only get angry about someone you really, really care about. "You know how many men have tried to defeat the great Oddna? You know how many have succeeded?"

"None," said Oddna with a great swelling of pride. "I'm entirely too powerful to be defeated by any but the chosen one, if he even exists. And if he does exist, I'm sure he's not a short, grubby, lame merchant from the backwater town of Robrecht."

"Yes, yes, mighty Oddna -- you are a rich, wise and powerful man. Quick to perceive your own advantage and capitalize on it. So I offer you a lucrative trade."

Oddna's red eyes narrowed, "A trade you say, tell me more..."

Colbac reached into his bag of holding and withdrew a large coin purse that he showed to be overflowing with gold. "I offer 100 gold pieces for the girl."

"Girl?" Oddna snorted, "A handsome woman, certainly, but not a girl."

"The offer stands, a 100," he hefted the purse and reconsidered, "A hundred and two gold pieces, for [THE INNKEEPER]"

"But I have such a love of her mutton sandwiches. Crisp and fatty and delicious."

"I cannot compel one so powerful as you to do anything, but my offer presents you with a clear choice -- mutton sandwiches, or the gold."

"Oh that word. I cannot abide that word. Or. So harsh on the pallet, so cruel to the ear. I do not accept ors."

Colbac nodded his head deeply in recognition. I understand Great Wizard. I understand. But all life is trade-offs. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Surely you understand this. The money or the girl."

"No, I'll take the and."

"And," asked Colbac.

"And," asked [THE INNKEEPER]

"Unh?" grunted the Orcs
 

# Wizard shows Boltac his Treasure Horde #


Deprecates how much money it is -- a lot perhaps for adventurers, but he is a noble. Besides, he cares 

I show it to you, so you may feel your failure all the more. And realize that money is nothing but a vulgar tool to me. As a shovel or pitchfork. Of course, these implements must be used, but they are not to be used by one in my lofty station. 


# Conflict at the End #


* Boltac goes on a rant about why can't you people be reasonable? Why can't you see your own advantage?

* Wizard shows him the source of all magic. Tell me you wouldn't want everything.

* No, I wouldn't want everything you jackass. Then I'd have to pay the upkeep on *everything*. And believe you me, that's expensive. Besides, if I had everything, who would I haggle with?

* Commerce, is so, so, impure.

* Oh, and liven' in the bottom of a hole in the ground with a lot of things you grew like a fungus that you call your friends.

* You take too many chances, Merchant. I have no friends. These are my servants.

* All alone in a dark hole in the ground and you don't have any friends. Not for nutting buddy, but now I'm feeling sorry for you. 

"I DON'T WANT YOUR PITY!" roared the Wizard.

"Okay, okay, I see you're upset --" began Boltac. But the Wizard waved his hand and the Orc's threw him over the edge of the pit. 

> Throw him into the pit. Let whatever has survived at the bottom, feed on him and shit his corpse out into eternal darkness. 

The Wizard walked to the edge and listened as the fat merchant crashed into things on the long way down. At the end, there was a deep, far off boom. 

"How's that for a counter-offer," said the Wizard. And then he turned back back to his work. 

Asarah put her head down and sobbed in the corner. 

Relan remained dead on the floor, not quite a hero. 

# Boltac in the Land of Misfit Toys #


>After all the talk of these things not having feelings. (Wizard to Asarah) we see them really having feelings here. 

He awoke on the floor and everything was in pain. 

Mishappen creatures come out of the dark, but they help him rather than hurt him. 

We have been shaped ourselves and we know the way of shaping life. 

He forgot to allow us the possibility of death. So we must go on for eternity. 

"My god, that's awful," said Boltac. In the corner an eyeball wept all by itself. 


They tell him that only if the magic is released. Only if the flame of magic is quenched from this dimension, can they be released. Only a hero like he can defeat the wiz

"What, you're saying I'm the chosen one? Chosen one. Look buddy, no offense, but I'm just a guy trying to make a coin in this world, you understand."

"In your heart, there is love."

"Love of coin, of course."

"There is more," whispered the shadow, "do not lie to me. In this place. There is no bargain you can make with the final darkness."

"C'mon, there's always room to negotiate."

"Not at the very end."

"C'mon, all the stories and the sagas and the miracle turnarounds."

Silence. 

"You mean the kid is really dead?"

And then the shadow told him something about how death worked that Boltac didn't know. Boltac saw an angle in it, but not for himself. 

"Okay, look, I love the girl. I do. And I figured it out too late and I didn't seize the opportunity and so now I'm hear and she's gone and I got the kid killed and there's nuttin' I can do about any of it. It sucks, but, that's the bidness."

# BOLTAC"S TURNing Moment #

** Problem: How do we get him to all is lost -- and use the coins to defeat the creatures? **

At most it's a distraction. It's stupid. It's the only chance he's got. Not because it's a way out (misfit toys offer that) but because he couldn't live with himself if he did anything else. 

He took a whiff of fresh air. He had a last glimpse of the trees through  secret way between the rocks. He made his goodbye to the world and then headed back into the darkness. 

This time it was harder. There was no light to follow. So he followed the darkness. Instead of heading towards the lightness and feeling of hope, at every turning he headed toward the feeling of stale, leaden fear. 

Finally he returned to the pool of darkness within the darkness. 

"You have returned," the shadow hissed in the darkness, "Why?"

"I need to find a way up."

"We told you, you must find the way out on your own."

"Not out, back up. And with all the crap that's down here, you can't tell me nobody dropped a torch."

# Boltac unleashes the coins #


# Asarah gives Boltac confidence to be king #

"You might not be able to be a King Mr. Boltac, but I could definitely be a Queen."

"But," said Boltac, "It's so much work,"

"Pfahh "

"But I wouldn't want have servants or slaves."

"Who said you have to have servant? And servants and slaves are two very different things."

"I know, dear," said Boltac.

"Aw, you called me dear."

"You don't like it?"

"No, I do. I really do." There was another kiss and then she continued. "But you don't need, servants. You don't have to force anyone to do anything. But can't you just hire people to help you."

"Hire, but servants are bound to the familiesâ€¦"

"You know while you are daydreaming, dear, you don't have to stick to the rules of reality. And are all servants bound to "

"Wait, wait, did you say hire," Boltac said, lapsing out of the sweet trance of cuteness for the first time since they had escaped.

He leaned out of the carriage window and shouted to Relan, "Turn this thing around, we're going the wrong way!"

"But Robrecht is south!" said Relan, "If there's anything left of it."

"Yeah, I know, but to save the city we gotta go North before we go South."

"I don't understand?"

"I know. That's not your job. It's my job. And speaking of which, do you want a job? I am hiring?"

"Wait, what? But I'm an adventurer."

"And can you possibly imagine anyone else who could have taken you on a bigger adventure?"

"No," said Relan, "But you had the adventure."

"Whattya mean, you were there? You were there the whole time!"

"But you got the girl at the end. That's the way an adventure works. You get the girl at the end and live happily ever after."

"I have two things to say to that. Eh, but never mind. We don't have time. Just trust me, the adventure ain't over yet."

"But we're out of danger," said Relan.

"Trust me, what I have in mind, kid. Probably get us all killed."

"Oh," said Relan, with a smile, "then I'm in!" And he urged the horse into a gallop. 

"Okay," Boltac shouted over the rushing of the air and the thudding of the horse's hooves. "You're hired. Now don't disturb me until we get there. I've got important business back here."

"Get where?" Relan shouted. 

"Oh, you'll know when we get there. I promise." And Boltac pulled his head back in the carriage.




# The Free Companions #

The free companions, I don't know why they call them that, because they sure don't come cheap. 

Whattya mean I'm not the King of Robrecht. I rode here in the King's Carriage. 

"That is a ducal carriage?"

"Yeah, and I drove the Duke out and took his carriage and his castle and his town."

"It is our town," sputtered Torvalds. 

"And you didn't drive me out. I was driven out by Orcs."

"En-henh," said Boltac. "Prove it."

"Prove it?" said the ex-Duke, "Why I am a descendant of a noble line. My word is my bond."

"Not with me it ain't. I've known too many nobles.
Yeah, that and six coppers will get you a foul tasting ale in Robrecht."


# Boltac Catches Rattick and Makes Him His Minister #

## Rattick escaping, time to head to the South -- to warmer climes

Back to Rattick's POV -- he escapes with his gold. He heads high into the mountains to a little village where he has a girl (he ha a girl in every village)

He figures things have cooled down, so he'll head South with his gold, to the Kingdoms of the Sun -- enjoy the life of luxury to which he can easily become accustomed. 

He actually makes it there (medieval Miami) and he is hit over the back of the head. Thrown in the back of the wagon. (the fog blowing through the wagon windows would have given it away if nothing else.)

He's caught at the border and hauled before the King 

"Wash yourself, you are to appear before the King."

"King of Robrecht? Everybody knows Robrecht doesn't have a King." 

Ranger cuffs him and tells him to be quiet. 


Colbac hires two legions of soliders

    "No Rattick, I don't want to trust you. I want you to try everything you possibly can. If I'm safe against my friends, I will be safe against my enemies."

    "My Lord, I am at your service."

    "And remove the sarcasm from your voice Rattick. I actually am a Lord now." He unfolded four sheets of paper. 

    He had gotten all the kingdoms to recognize him as king in return for a treaty that allied Robrecht 

    "You will go to war with everyone?"

    "No. We will be neutral."

    "Neutral," asked Rattick, "you mean as a ruse?"

    "No, I mean we will be neutral."


    And you are Lord Colbac?

    "No Rattick, I have adopted a new name constituent with my new station in life. I am the first Lord Robrecht. Now kneel before me and accept your knighthood." 

    "Knighthood?"

    "Yes Rattick. What's the matter? You think Kings shouldn't have a sense of humor."

    "This is going to be a very different sort of kingdom, my liege," Rattick said without a hint of sarcasm."

    "Yes, Rattick, it is. There's no magic anymore, Rattick. Who knows where the progress will stop."

    "Progress is magic, my liege."

    "Well spoken, Rattick. I distrust your flattery, but well spoken."

    "You are right to do so, my liege."

    "Just so."

Rattick is stopped at the border. He is dragged before the King -- turns out to be Colbac

The Merchant Heroic. The Bourgeois Heroic. The Burgher Heroic.

## Rattick at the end. 

    At the end he asks the guard why he serves a merchant, oh, well me, when there's no fighting to be done, I serve gold. But when edge meet edge, I follow courage. 

    Courage, but he's a merchant, a particularly cunning and greedy one, who drives a hard bargain. 

    He's the King -- but before that he was a hero -- do you know what he did before he became a merchant -- saved blah blah blah.  



# Boltac Confronts the Old Duke and Torvalds #

"Your nephew was just lacking that special something that nobility is supposed to have."

"Courage?"

"You know, I was going to say nobility, 'cause it's sounds more poetic, but no. What you're nephew lacks is smarts. No offense your Dukedom, but ya an idiot."

"You can't talk to me like that."

"Shut up," Boltac and Torvalds said at the same time. 

"So, you know why people fight wars?"

"I fight them to win."

"Nah, what you really fight for, is a better negotiating position. And if you do it right, you don't even have to fight. Right?"

"Yes," said Torvald's through a wolf's smile, "That's close enough. You're a cunning man, it's going to be a shame to have you put to death. "

You're not in a position to negotiate

Because you have the army. 

"Yes, yes, because I have the army." Torvalds motioned for the Companions to take Boltac away. But no one moved. "Oh, you dullards, take him."

"Are you sure it's your army?"

"What do you mean, I have hired them."

"Well, about that. You haven't paid them."

"And, as it turns out, I got there first. And I had a chest fulla gold, so, uh, boys, take him a way. "

"we've got mountain passes, asshole. We're on the trade road to everywhere. And now, we've got a kingdom. And we're in business for ourselves."

# Not So Nice Ending #

Boltac assumes that Asarah will be his. 

She accuses him of bargaining. Trying to buy her with his rescue attempt. But she's not up for it. It's emotionally false -- a step removed from cheating her out of a drink. You just expect. 

He somehow has to humble and humiliate himself -- or let her go. A tough emotional resolution. 

He just kisses her.


# The Nice Ending #

Asarah and Boltac eating, she is sad. He presents her with the sign he took from the ruins of the Inn.
