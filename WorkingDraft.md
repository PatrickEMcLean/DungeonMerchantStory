# **The Merchant Adventurer** 



## POV TRICK 

Jump point of view to loser of combat

to Boltac
to Troll
to Orc
to Relan when he gets whacked

Except to Relan at end when he takes out wizard. (The one win.)


## Punchlist 


* Do we need to set up Boltac's necklace of lucky charms -- with the whistle -- one from every creed or culture or god. Just in case. Then he flits through his necklace. 

I thought you hated magic?

I do. It's not magic. It's insurance. 

En-henh, she said, mocking him. 

* At the end, he throws the charm necklace into the River Swift. 

Are you not afraid anymore?

More afraid than ever! Boltac exclaimed. Now that I'm King, I'm not just afraid for me. I'm afraid for everybody else too. 

Then why did you? 

Because that's my job. Shielding them from the fear. I don't know what kind of King I'm going to be, but if the people see that their King is afraid. They will be afraid. 

Whatever darkness. It is best to face it square on. 

Why Boltac, you're starting to sound like a hero. 

Boltac made a sour face at her, then looked across the river. "En-henh," was all he said. 


* Move up Relan's death, so that Boltac sees it before he plunges into the pit. 

"Age and cunning will always overcome" -- tag the final twist with Boltac saying - Age and cunning. 

* Make Dimsbury want food from the beginning. (add in intro discussion, wine hurts his stomach)
3. Set up kidnapping (do this earlier. )

* Have the kid find the love of his life, but the scoundrels are in on it. -- They let him know it was a con, and they are getting out. 

>But you broke your vows for me.
>I was never a real priestess.

* squeezing into elven mail
* add Boltac stubbornly refusing to use the kid's name as a funny bit. 
*  Boltac opening up the empty treasury. 
* have the Wizard forget the sandwiches -- but he has the next best thing -- a supply of sandwiches
* Conform names: make sure that Farm boy becomes Relan -- wizard becomes Dimsbury, or the Wizard Dimsbury.
* Add a bit about the importance of lighting to adventurers
* link Boltac's lack of faith -- when he speaks to Asarah -- to him saying -- the crazy wizard was right. A merchant can't have power. To which Asarah says. The crazy wizard is dead. Defeated by a merchant. That is power Boltac. Have faith in yourself. In you I see more than a drink-thief. And you should too. 
* BOltac uses magic nullifying gloves at the end.
* Make sure, Dimsbury is sucked into the source of all magic at the end. 
* What happens to the Troll? Is he still stuck there at the end? 
* BOltac picks up the mace, signifying that magic is done for. 
* All my magic items are worthless, Huzzah.

* Make up sagas for Relan to quote from in one or two places. (A la Don Quixhote.)
* Make sure "She was a virgin when we met" makes sense"

* make sure the maces match up. From the shop and # 21 

* Boltac struggling to find something in the sack to create suspense. "That's the problem with a bottomless sack, you can put everything in it, but then you can't find a damn thing." 

* have rattick kill the troll over Relan's protests. 


# Dimsbury Lectures About Magic.


"Magic is like a vast, underground reservoir of water," began Dimsbury, droning into what was shaping up to be a long lecture. 
"Is that why you live in the earth like a gopher."
"No, not literally underground, you thick, literal man, I mean it pools and flows beneath the surface of our reality. Beneath all realties, in fact. And I have found a way to coax it to the surface. Draw this energy to us. And create a deeper, broader opening than any "
"So your digging a well for magic? Is that it?"
"Close enough for a coarse man such as you."
"En-henh."
 

# Rattick v Wizard


> When Rattick goes in front of the Wizard he tries to pin the flaying of an orc on them. They're the real sickos. I'm your faitful servant Rattick!






# Boltac can't be king -- lantern

At the very end, Boltac uses the Lantern as an example of why he can't be King. He's not pure of heart.

Asarah, I'm not sure kings should be pure of heart. In fact, for what you have to do, I'm pretty sure it's better off if they're not. Kings are underhanded bastards who negotiate using armies as bargaining chips. 


""We don't have an army.

"Then we need a very, very good negotiator."


## Lantern 

 The last thing he grabbed on his way out was the brass and Turquoise lantern. "To lamptopolis," he muttered. 

Bag of Holding. 

 



>Does Relan complain that the Orc's all have such cool boots.
>For every Orc he kills, he tries on his boots -- but none of them fit, through the entire story. 

> Hey, uh, Farm Boy. You are frighteningly strong and fairly unimaginative. Is there a village of you louts somewheres?

> yes, said, relan, why do you ask.

> Cause it's about to be a very rich village. And you, are about to be a hero. 


Does Relan get killed and brought back?


# 1

"I'm the chosen one. Only I can bring peace and restore balance to the land," said the blonde Knight in Shining™ Armor.

"You still don't understand," said the Ranger, clad-in-mail. He hiked up his sleeve and showed a mark that was burned into his arm. "This symbol of the Cruel God Azaz, signifies,"

"Azaz my Az-ass! that your whore of a mother spilled bacon fat on you when you were a child."

The two men drew swords and faced off on either side to the trail. But before either of them swung, a thin man, dressed in faded black, stepped between them. He said, "Please my Lords, please, we mustn't fight among ourselves."

"Out of my way Rattick! You are but a hireling!" cried the Ranger, "It is my destiny to run him through."

"Your destiny? Don't be absurd. I am the CHOSEN ONE!" shrieked the Knight.

"Perhaps," said Rattick, "You have both been chosen." They stopped, swords frozen in the murderous air that hung between them, to consider this possibility. Rattick continued, "We go to face a mighty foe. A powerful wizard in a deep dungeon. Perhaps all the others have failed not because they didn't have *a* chosen one, but because they didn't have *enough* chosen ones."

"I AM THE CHOSEN ONE!" they both shouted.

Okay, thought Rattick, that was a mistake. Best to let the morons fight it out. But before he could step off the field of battle(idiocy) the Enchantress chimed in, "Don't talk to him like that," she said, "He is a member of this party. Moreover, the sacred vows I have taken at the Shrine of Lauranda, means that I must treat all beings with courtesy and respect, and eat nothing that has a face," she intoned with reverence.

Surprisingly, this worked. The men lowered their swords and apologized (apologized!) to each other. Rattick stared longingly at the Enchantress and the belt of gold rings that encircled her hips over the robe of white she wore. She was beautiful, perhaps there was a way... No. Better not to think of it. 

"Forgive me good Rattick," said the Knight, his head bowed slightly, "Though it is true that we have hired you to guide us to the lair of foul  Wizard Dimsbury, you have served us true and are a member of this party."

"We brave companions," said the Ranger, "we happy few, each, in our own way, fulfilling a mystical and wondrous destiny. Yes, we are all sorry to have used you so badly faithful Rattick."

Rattick stood there with his mouth hanging open. Could they be serious? Were they conning him rather than the other way around? With an effort of will, he snapped his mouth shut and pasted a smile across it. "Not at all, good sirs," said Rattick. "We are adventurers! Spirits run high with ones so bold as we." 

"Huzzah!" cried the Knight, as he lifted his heavy blade in the air. 

"Huzzah," cried the Ranger, clanging his blade against sword of the man he was very recently going to run through. 

"Huzzah," giggled the Enchantress, clapping her hands together and sending a tiny fireball up to dance against the blades.

"Christ Almighty," thought Rattick as he lifted his dagger in half-hearted salute.

A few hours later, they emerged from the forest and Rattick announced, "This is it."

"What do you mean?" asked the Ranger, "You mean this? It's just a door in the side of a hill."

"You expected a sign?" asked Rattick. 

"Well, I... I don't know what I expected."

"Yes, that's why you hired me to guide you here."

"No good fellow," protested the Ranger, "Don't wound me like that. You are no longer hireling, but companion, member of our brave band."

"Yeah, yeah," said Rattick, "Let's get to it." He reached for the handle of the door, but before his hand could touch it the Enchantress interrupted. 

"Stop! We must first seek the supplication of Lauranda. Her blessing will keep us save during our time of trial." The Knight and the Ranger both drew their swords and knelt. Rattick rolled his eyes. Just get it over with. He didn't know how much more amateur hour he could take. But he consoled himself with the knowledge that it would all be over soon. 

The Enchantress completed her babbling, and they ventured into the Wizard's lair. It did not take long before Rattick could hear  rumblings and gnashing of teeth from the darkness ahead of them. The Troll was still there and he sounded hungry. "Stay here, faithful companions," he said, playing it for all it is worth, "I will use my mastery of stealth and shadow to scout the way."

He handed his torch to the Ranger and disappeared into the darkness. As soon as he rounded the corner he stopped and squatted down in the passageway. Scout ahead? Faithful companions? What nonsense. Rattick wasn't sticking his neck out any farther than he had to. He waited. 

When Rattick returned to the pool of torchlight, he donned an expression of fear and, with a skill long practiced, trembled as he spoke. "It is a *Troll* my companions. A creature most large and fearsome. I fear it is more than we can defeat. We should turn back."

"Ha ha ha ha!" laughed the Knight, falling for it. "A Troll! That is nothing to a Knight of the Yarven Dawn."

"And it is even less to the blessed and Chosen of Azaz," said the Ranger, reaching for his sleeve to reveal the strange mark on his arm 

Rattick swallowed his disgust and said, "You are so much braver and stronger than I."

As he drew his sword, the Knight said, "Stay behind me and learn how it is done. Fear not Rattick, for you are in the company of heroes."

"I shall not let you steal the glory!" cried the Ranger as he shouldered the Knight aside. 

Rattick couldn't believe it. The idiots charged! A frontal assault on a Troll? They were so stupid he wondered how they had remembered to breathe on the trek in. 

The Enchantress edged passed him, smelling of exotic perfume. "I will see if I can bind the creature with The Mother's Embrace. Stay behind me and you will be safe."

He followed her through through the corridor. There was a roar and the stench of something awful. Rattick knew this to be Troll's breath. Nothing smells worse than rotting flesh trapped between teeth.

When she saw the Troll the Enchantress raised her hands and began casting a spell. As her hands began to weave an intricate the pattern,  Rattick slid his knife across her perfect, alabaster white throat. She gasped as her life's blood poured down her neck and over her the exquisite Ruby necklace. Before she could make another sound, Rattick caught her gently and dragged her into the darkness. 

She looked up at Rattick and mouthed the word, "Why?" Rattick tore the necklace from her throat. Then he wiped the blood from it with a black silk handkerchief. In the distance, the screams of one the chosen one's ended in a terrible, squishy, bone-crunching noise.

Staring into the glittering facets of the Ruby, Rattick said, "Why? Because it was a kindness. Because there are worse things in the depths of this dungeon than you can imagine. Because this is what happens when you chose to play a dangerous game. All of those are close enough, but if you really want the truth..."

He looked down from his prize and saw that life had left her body. He knelt, and not without tenderness, closed her eyes with his finger tips. "Because I can."


# 2

Rattick threw the necklace on the oak counter and watched the light dance in it like a living thing. He nodded at it and asked, "Have you ever seen such exquisite workmanship?"

Boltac, the merchant on the other side of the counter, picked up the Ruby Necklace and looked at it closely. He gave Rattick a hard look. Then he licked his thumb, rubbed the setting and muttered, "you missed a spot."

"Missed a spot?" asked Rattick, as smooth as water over river rock. 

"Blood, Rattick. There's some blood left on this necklace."

Rattick shrugged. "Probably mine. I try to use stealth, but the Orc I took it from put up quite a fight."

"En-henh," Boltac said as ran his hand across his shaven pate, "Not that I want to know, but what is an Orc?"

"A fearsome new creature wreaking havoc on the good people of Robrecht."

"En-henh," said Boltac, not buying it, "And, you uh, count yourself among those good people?" 

"Of course. I am no mighty hero, like some, but I do the small part that I can."

"Okay, Rattick, I'm gonna make you an offer on your necklace here. The setting is crap, but the stone is very nice. But before I do, not for nuttin' but Orcs? You're shittin' me right?"

"Oh no, stout merchant, I assure you, Orcs are very real."

"Really? Kobolds, I heard of. Trolls, I heard of. Dragons, sure, but Orcs? C'mon. What does an Orc look like?"

"Gentle Merchant, I hope that you never see one, but I assure you, if you do, you will know it is an Orc."

"En-henh,"

"Let me tell you the fearsome tale of how I came to acquire this necklace and then perhaps you will better understand the threat that the fearsome Orc--"

"You can spare me the story, Rattick," said Boltac.

"You don't enjoy tales of valor?" asked Rattick with a smile.

"Tales of Valor? No. I enjoy tales of profit."

"I don't know any sagas that involve tales of profit," said Rattick, "But tales of valor, of great daring... The bards sing many songs of those."

"Yeah, I don't really care for singing either. In fact, let's just cut all the bullshit. I'm pretty sure I know how you got this."

"Yessssss," purred Rattick, running his finger over the Ruby, "but do you care?"

"Not if you'll take 15 gold for it I don't."

"15 gold? I risked my neck for this!""

"You? I'm pretty sure *you* risked somebody else's neck for this particular bauble. Fine, 17 for the gem, and 2 gold for the rest of it." Boltac said, indicating the pile of equipment on the floor. 

"But this sword almost defeated a troll!"

"Yeah, and it almost doesn't have that huge nick in it. And why does everything in that pile smell like Troll shit?"

They haggled for a while, and settled on 22 gold for the lot. When Rattick left, Boltac muttered a curse and refrained from spitting on his own floor. 

He placed the Ruby in one of three lockboxes behind the counter and then dragged the bundle of equipment into the back to see how badly he had been taken. The sword was higher quality than he had hoped for, and there were a number of items that, while they wouldn't fetch top price, would provide good use. The odd piece of armor, some leather goods. He threw out a badly damaged boot and was debating opening a nondescript fabric sack. Sacks could be trouble. For that matter so could gems. 

He grunted as he stood up and trudged back to the front of the store. He reached under the counter and, after some effort, removed a heavy, brass-tipped wand from it's mounting. He took the wand to the back and guided it carefully over all the items. 

It did not grow warm or shriek or vibrate or any of the many colorful and destructive things it did in the presence of magic. Strictly speaking it was not a magic wand, it was a magic *detecting* wand. Very rare, very expensive. But, for a man in dealing in items of unknown origins delivered by questionable characters, it was indispensable. 

"Ennh," grunted Boltac, more relieved than disappointed. Boltac hated magic. It wasn't just dangerous, it was also bad for business. When a customer can't try on a pair of gloves for fear that they would turn out to be MaGrief's Gauntlets of Self-Abuse, business suffered. 

That's why he kept the wand secreted under his the counter. Pick up a cursed Ruby Necklace and there was no telling what might happen. Before he had procured his wand, Boltac had spend six months with a cursed Goblet of Thirst stuck to his hand. As annoying as that was, that wasn't the worst part of the curse. When liquid -- any liquid -- was poured into the the Goblet, it heated and burned the hand that held it.

He rubbed the scarred flesh of his left hand. Ugh, magic. It seemed like it should be useful, but it's power always went awry. Maybe it was fate. Maybe it was karma. Maybe it was that Wizards enjoyed a particularly cruel and ironic sense of humor. Whatever it the reason, Boltac was certain that the world would be better off without magic. But there was nothing to be done about it. People may revile a merchant, but in the end, he could only sell what the buyers want. 

The copper bell clattered against the front door. Boltac tucked the wand inside his sleeve and hurried to see what profit that Bitch Goddess Fortune had seen fit to bring him this time. 


# 3

At the front of the store, Boltac found a strapping young lad, farm boy no doubt, staring at a rack of swords with an open mouth. The boy was so entranced by the cold and lethal steel on the wall that he didn't even turn when  Boltac entered the room. Boltac slid behind the counter, replaced the magic detecting wand and then asked, "Can I help you?"

"I need a sword," said the farm boy, his eyes not leaving the weaponry. 

"Then you have come to right place. Welcome, my young friend, to Boltac's General Store and Dungeon Outfittery. We have everything that a strapping young adventurer like yourself could need to loot your way to fame and glory."

"We?" asked the lad, with the kind of innocence that can only come from hard work, clean living and getting kicked in the head by livestock. 

"Yes, the Royal We, or, in this case, the Shopkeeper's We."

"But there is only one of you?"

"Yes, but I am so eager to help you, I will work as hard as two men. Now, what's the story? Who you gotta stab? Who you gonna loot?"

"No," said the FarmBoy hanging his head in embarrassment, "It's  not like that. I don't want to loot anybody. I… I just have to… I mean, I am about to embark on an adventure of high purpose and consequence." With this last phrase, Boltac's hopes rose. Maybe the kid was a little slow, but those fancy words sounded like money. He smiled like a fleshy shark.

"My friend, you have come to the right place. High purpose and consequence is what we are all about at Boltac's. Why the Duke of Robrecht himself has granted me my license to purvey. He has an eye to quality, his Dukeship does, and his warrant of commerce personally guarantees that this," he indicated his dark, dusty store with an expansive gesture of his hands, "Is the finest merchandise you can buy in town of Robrecht."

"But, it's the only merchandise I can buy in the town of Robrecht."

"Yes, I see that you are a quick study," said Boltac, directing the young man through the shelves. "I invite you to direct your keen wit towards my wares. Here we have an assortment of torches and oil-bearing devices. If you notice this one, with the curved blade on the handle -- particularly good if you are surprised coming around a corner.

Boltac turned sharply and indicated a floor-to-ceiling rack of glass bottles, "Here, of course, we have our major and minor healing potions. A must for any prudent adventurer. These potions are brewed by the finest Mercian apothecaries and brought in by mule train once a moon."

Moving right along, Boltac directed his young shopper towards the racks in the back, "And here is the Armor. a must for all but barbarians and the most self-confident magic workers. You aren't a magic worker are you?"

"I don't think so," said the lad, a little overwhelmed by how fast this was all coming at him. 

"Perfect, then you have your choice of chain mail, splint mail, ring mail, plate mail, plate armor and  -- far less protection but the girls love it -- leather armor. Feel that? Very supple."

"But what I need is a sword," protested the young man.

"En-henh," said Boltac, "Which brings us to lighting. A question of prominent importance to any adventurer."

The Farm Boy looked  longingly back at the swords.

"I know, I know," continued Boltac. You think the thing with the pointy end is the most important bit of gear you can buy."

"A hero's life depends on the strength of his blade." 

"Sometimes. But there are two things, I can *guarantee* you are going to need. 1) Water. 2) Light."

"What about food?"

"Eh, you can live for days without food. A strong lad like you could eat what he kills, but without water… not so much. And the dark. Are you comfortable in the dark."

"I have walked this land at night since I was a small child."

"And now that you're a big child… I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm just having fun. My point here is, you know what lives far, far underground, in the darkness?"

"I do not, but I am ready to boldly face the unknown."

"Ennn-henh. You got no idea. For that matter, neither do I. But what I *do* know is that whatever horrible underground thing you mean to bash to a pulp in the name of your personal fame or fortune, you can bet that, *it* can see in the dark."

The Farm Boy stood there with a brave, yet stupid look on his face.

"And you know what can't see in the dark?"

"Uh…"

"You. You can't see in the dark. Can you?"

"No."

"Then trust me, you pain-in-the-ass, take a lantern. In fact, take two and some torches, just in case."

"What about that one," the Farm Boy asked, pointing to a lamp that hung on it's own peg high on the wall. 

"Oh, that, you have a very good eye, my lad. That is the magic lantern of Lamptopolis. It cannot be broken and it never goes out as long as it's carried."

"Lamptopolis?" asked the Farm Boy.

"Okay, you caught me, I made it up. But it's a lantern and it's clearly magic."

"It's beautiful. How does it work?"

"It's magic. That's how it works. Some kinda glowing crystal in the center there. But trust me, it can't be broken."

"How do you know that?"

"Ennh, you've never had apprentices have you? Third rule of shopkeeping: If a thing can't be broken by an apprentice, it can't broken. Now lemme see here. It's got an inscription on it…"

Boltac lifted it from it's resting place. As soon as he put a glow on it's handle the crystal in the center of the lamp flickered to life. "Yeah," Boltac said, rubbing the dust from the letters cut across the bottom of the lantern's base. "It says, 'burns with the flame of a true heart. We'll, it's not much of a flame, is it. But at least you don't have to carry oil for it."

He handed the lantern to the Farm Boy. As soon as the Boy touched the handle, the lantern blazed with brilliant light so bright, Boltac realized it had been a long, long time since he had cleaned the store. 

"Wow," said the Farm Boy. 

"Give me that," snapped Boltac, snatching the lantern from the boys hand. It returned to a dull flicker. 

"How much is it?"

"More than you can afford," Boltac grumbled as he hung the lantern back on the peg.

"That's okay," said the Farm Boy in a fresh-faced and agreeable way that just made Boltac hate him all the more, "what I really need is a sword." 

"Maybe you do and maybe you don't. Keep an open mind for me. We've got Pikes, Bows, Warhammers, Battle Axes, Halberds, Flails, Morningstars, Maces and the largest selection of Fine Daggers this side of the mountains."

"I don't want a mace. I want a sword."

"Of course you do. And once again, Boltac's has you covered! We've got short swords, long swords, broadswords, rapiers, cutlasses, sabers, scimitars, shishkas, and slabas -- and I did I mention the finest selection of daggers of quality, this side of the mountains. While it's true that most of our blades have never been tested in battle, this is in keeping with our philosophy of passing the savings and the glory on to you."

"Well, uh, I'm afraid..."

"Afraid? A big strapping lad like you? Don't be ridiculous. Why, after you've been properly outfitted by Uncle Boltac, you'll have nothing to fear in this world. You'll be able to take on a Dragon with one hand and an OwlBear with the other. And therein lies the value of quality equipment."

"No, it's just that, I'm afraid that those beautiful swords," his eyes grew wide as he looked at them, "are all too expensive for me." 

The smile drained from Boltac's face, but he continued as if he hadn't just been kicked in the wallet. "Don't be silly. At Boltac's we have equipment to fit every budget." He kicked a bucket of swords next the counter. "Have a look at our discount bucket."

The lad pulled a sword from the bucket and then dropped it back in quickly. "This sword still has blood on it!"

"That's how you know that it works! A gold piece gets you the pick of the barrel."

"A gold piece?" said the lad, looking concerned. 

"Well," said Boltac, who was starting to get a very bad feeling about the entire transaction, "At Boltac's there's always room to negotiate. But try a few, see how you like the balance."
 
"I've been trying to save money to buy a sword, sir. Scrounging for herbs, seeing if anyone needs rats killed. But no one needs rats killed. And the countryside is bare for miles around…" He trailed off.

Boltac nodded understandingly. The only vermin that plagued Robrecht was an infestation of down-on-their luck adventurers. "I understand how it is. And how much have you been able to save?"

"Not enough, I'm afraid. So I was wondering if I could rent a sword."

"RENT A SWORD?" Boltac shouted. "Do you not see the sign?" he asked pointing at the sign which clearly read "All Sales Final."

"I can't read, sir."

"Oh, of course not."

"Please sir, it's so I can rescue the love of my life. She was taken, you see. Abducted by scoundrels."

"Oh well, that changes everything," said Colbac, as his face grew hard. "Tell me more," he asked, as if it was a dare.

"Well sir, she is a priestess of Dar. And, well,"

"Aren't they supposed to be virgins? The priestesses of Dar."

The young man blushed and said, "It's more of a suggestion, than a rule, sir. If you know what I mean," his face grew serious, "but if it helps, I was a virgin, if you catch my drift."

"Help? How would that help?"

"She's gone and got herself into trouble. I've gotten word from a friend that she's being held in a tower and requires a hero to rescue her."

"So what's keeping this broad from walking outta this tower herself?"

"Broad? Sir, you speak of the love of my life--"

"You're life hasn't been that long yet."

"--and she's been placed at the top of the tower and sleeps a deathless sleep under an evil spell."

"En-henh. That's a Sleeping Beauty," Boltac said. He was about to explain  that the Sleeping Beauty was the name of con game, popular among some of Robrecht's less-than-upstanding citizens, whereby a young man was seduced, lured into a trap and relieved of any valuable items he might have. Like, for instance, a borrowed sword. But the Farm Boy had bolted from the barn and there was no catching him now. 

"Yes, she is a *real* beauty, sir. Asleep or awake. I knew you would understand. So, if I had a sword, I could go and rescue her. And there would certainly be treasure after I defeated the the monsters that have been set to protect her from all the but the bravest and most faithful hero. Understand, I have no care for this treasure. Only my lady love. So all the valuables would be yours. All that for loaning me a sword." 

Boltac winced under the onslaught of the boy's sincerity. "But just a sword? I mean, would armor would help too?"

"Yes, it would, but…"

"And some healing potions, you know, just to be safe."

"Well, of course, but"

"And perhaps a flying steed. White, with large flapping wings."

"You have a flying steed?" the boy asked in awe. 

"Even if I did, you couldn't afford it."

"But, we're talking about a loan."

"No, *you're* talking about a loan. I'm sorry, you're just gonna have to find yourself another Priestess of Eternally Questionable Virtue, kid."

"Look, I'm not asking for armor or a flying horse, I'm just asking to borrow a sword."

Boltac looked the boy dead in the eyes and said, "I'm not giving you any discounts."

"It's not a discount. It's a loan."

"It's the worst kind of discount. It's a 100% discount."

"But I'd bring it back. Maybe with a few nicks, but definitely covered in glory."

"Oh Glory is it? Would that enhance the retail value?"

"Yes, yes," he said eagerly, unaware of the trap he was falling into.

"Because you are such a great fighter."

"Yes, that's it."

"Powerful, strong," Boltac prompted.

"Yes."

"Ready for danger from any quarter."

"I might not look like much, sir, but I'll be a mighty hero yet."

"All you need is a sword? Is that right?"

"Yes, please, Sir. Please. Haven't you ever been young and in love?"

Boltac's face soured. "I was never young.

"Look, kid, I'm not going to loan you a sword. But I do have an old mace I keep behind the counter, you know, in case of trouble. It's not much to look at, but it's always been lucky for me. I like to think it would be good luck for you. Would you like to see it?"

"Very much."

Boltac lifted the mace up from behind the counter. As he raised the weapon high in the air, the lad's trusting, cow-like eyes followed it, studying every detail of the well-worn wood, wrapped leather handle, and the business end studded with heavy iron nails. Boltac saw the lad move from disappointment to to hope. "Yes," his eyes seemed to say, "a mace. I could do it with a mace."

Boltac hit him right between the eyes, and knocked him out cold.

> give the wizard some kind of tag or visual cue so we know him when he talks to Boltac

In the center of Robrecht, there was a river. In the center of this river was an island occupied by a very damp castle. And in the very damp center of this very damp castle was a Duke on a throne. Both of which were also damp. And one of them was terribly bored.

The Duke yawned mightily, then thought the better of it. He was holding court. Well, such as court as could be held in the remote and unimpressive Dutchy of Robrecht. There were no glittering courtiers, there were no ladies-in-waiting, there was just the Duke, an uncomfortable wooden chair and a long line of disputes that the Duke was supposed to settle before he would be allowed to go to his supper. 

"Messers Rudolph and Fuad, herders of goats!" the Chamberlain announced. The Duke waved his hand in acknowledgement and the men were brought before him.

"He had advantage of my goat, sire. And I desire compensation," said the cross-eyed man as glared in the approximate direction of the man next to him. The Duke turned his gaze at the accused, a man who was wearing a goat-skin helmet. Was the helmet this man's idea of formal dress, the Duke wondered? The Duke opened his mouth as if to speak, but then thought better of it. 

The pause stretched to a such a length that the Chamberlain gently prompted, "Sire?"

"Advantage?" asked the Duke, unable, with his formal, courtly upbringing, to understand how having a goat might be an advantage. It's not that there were no goats in the Mercian Empire. It's that he had been insulated from all creatures that were shaggy and uncultured from the time he had left the womb.

"He had knowledge of my best NannyGoat."

"Knowledge? I don't understand, of course he has knowledge of your animal," he said, glancing at the dull-eyed, leather-helmeted man who was being accused of bestiality, "he is a fellow-goatherd, is he not?"

"No my lord," said the cross-eyed man, blushing with the weight of what he must now make painfully obvious. "He..." and he thrust his pelvis forward and backwards in an unmistakeable, rhythmic motion. 

"Oh. Oh? OH!" said the Duke, as facts of the case came into focus for him. "Really. What was it like?" asked the Duke.

The Chamberlain began to cough. This was a pre-arranged signal between the two that the Duke was wandering dangerously off course. The Chamberlain did a lot of coughing. 

"Very well," the Duke said, "I command you to violate one of his sheep."

"WHAT!"

"Yes, yes, my good man, that is justice. He has had one of yours, so you must have one of his. An eye for an eye and a ewe for a ewe. Yes, that has the ring of justice to it. Symmetry." The Duke said, feeling awfully proud of himself. But by the look on the goatherd's face, he could see that his legal acumen was lost on the man. 

The Chamberlain continued to cough. The Duke became worried about how he might talk his way out of his ruling without seeming that he was contradicting himself. The Duke, was aware, vaguely, that he was not the sharpest arrow in the quiver. But he was straight on one point: The only mortal sin a person in power might truly commit was seeming to contradict themselves. 

He couldn't understand where he had gone wrong? What taboo had he crossed? It was a perfectly logical verdict. He was a perfectly logical ruler. And why did rulers have to explain themselves to their subjects anyway? Maybe it was just Dukes. He was pretty sure if he was a King he wouldn't have had to explain himself to anyone. 

Just has he was thinking that, a Wizard appeared in the great hall. And this is not to say he made an entrance. One minute there was an empty space on the cold stone floor and the next, there he stood. Shaven pate, black robes, dark circles under his eyes, strange stains underneath his fingernails -- one moment he wasn't there, and the next, he was. The Wizard Appeared.  

There was a gasp as those in the great hall, jumped back from the man who had appeared in their midst. Nonplussed, the Chamberlain said, "A man appearing from nowhere!" 

The Wizard looked at the Chamberlain sharply and hissed, "My name is Alston Dimsbury."

"Dimsbury, A wizard of considerable evil," the Chamberlain said. But the wizard's look darkened and more imaginative people in the crowd believed that they saw flames forming in the Wizard's eyes. 

"…who's reputation is much maligned," the Chamberlain added diplomatically. 

"Yes, enough, that's quite enough," said the Duke. "Wizard, you will simply have to wait your turn."

"Oh," said the Wizard. "I hope this isn't convenient for you. I *am* sorry. Pray, continue with your amusements. My time is of little consequence." He punctuated his sentence with a wave of his hand that turned the cross-eyed goatherd in a rather lovely-looking brown and white nanny goat. This time, even the Chamberlain gasped in fear. 

Fuad, the Goatherd in the leather helmet, smiled at the newly-minted goat with an unwholesome gleam in his eye. As he rubbed his hand along the length of rope that held up his trousers, the Nanny goat gave up a fearful bleat.

The Wizard said, "Please, don't let me interrupt."

No one spoke. The only sound was the clacks of the goat's hooves as she/he wisely made for the exit as fast as her/his terribly confused legs would carry her.

Exasperated that the still crowd wasn't getting the point, the Wizard said, "What does it take? Must I strike all of you down with a pillar of flame? Gah. Let me outline it for you.  I am a *horrible* man. Dimsbury the terrible. Master of the arcane arts and elder mysteries, summoner of demons, so on and so forth, so GIVE ME THE ROOM. Now, go. Flee."

And so they did. And when the oaken door slammed behind them, the Wizard and the Duke were the only people left in the room. 

"There," said the Wizard, "That's better."

"Hullo, Alston, enjoying yourself?"

"Quite Weevston. You know how I do like to make an entrance."

"I apologize for my subjects," said the Duke, "they are a bit... provincial."

"Thick is the word I would have used."

"Would you care for some wine," asked the Duke as he draped his leg over the side of his chair and slumped with the false exhaustion that only comes with never having worked a day in your life.

"I want you to *get out*," said the Wizard.

"Uh? Pardon me?"

"I said, get out. Abdicate. Leave this place. And take everyone with you."

"I wish that I could," said the Duke, "I never wanted to come to this damp, grey place to begin with."

"Ah, well there you go," said the Wizard, "I love it when things are easy. Did you say there was wine?"

"Sadly," said the Duke.

"Sadly? I thought you said there was wine?"

"Oh wine? We've got it by the barrelful. And by the bottleful in cabinet over there. Since you've run off all my servants, subjects and goat herders, you will have help yourself. All told this tower and keep contains more wine than I could drink in three lifetimes. Although the prospect of staying here for three lifetimes," the Duke chuckled as he made a slicing motion across his throat."

"I don't think you understand," said the Wizard, trying to be reasonable, "this is a courtesy call. What I mean to say is that this request is for your benefit, not mine."

"Steady on, old boy," said the Duke. "I'm on your side. I'm ready to do as you command. You want this kingdom -- well this dismal little duchy -- I say you can have it. Good riddance to fickle mountain weather, thick-ankled peasant girls and goat violators of every shape and stripe. But, here's the thing, I can't. The minute I leave my post, my family will know of it. In particular my Uncle Torvald, do you know my Uncle Torvald?"

"Can't say I have had the pleasure," said Dimsbury, fighting back an urge to engulf the Duke in flames with a clap of his hands. 

"I have the burden of carrying a great name. Weeveston Prestidigitous RampartLion Toroble the 15th, in fact. And this name means that I am not free do what I would like. I am not free to marry who I like. I am not free to live where I like. I have been sent here. And if I abdicate, Torvald Toroble will have me killed. Either by assassin or generalship of an army on it's way to a glorious lost cause or perhaps just with a good old-fashioned hunting accident."

"How do you know?" asked Wizard, still trying to reason with him. 

"It's how he did my father. Hunting "accident." And when dear old Dad survived that, then Torvalds sent his very own doctor to poison the man."

"Damn it, man," cried Alston, "I'm trying very hard not to be the stereotypical Evil Wizard. But you're just not helping. I don't want to be a stereotype. Don't make me be a stereotype."

"I never suggested that you were," said the Duke, with a look of care on his face.

"I could have swept in from the East and just taken that mine and cavern system for myself. Killed all the miners, released horrible creatures into the countryside. Right? Could have done that, couldn't I?"

"Yes, Alston you could have, but I don't feel that you are the kind of --"

"But instead, I bought that mine. Paid gold on the barrel head for it. Didn't I?"

"You did. Please, Alston, what has gotten into you? You are a fine neighbor." said the Duke, trying to tell this powerful and somewhat crazed man what he wanted to hear. 

"Yes, I am," the Wizard said, calming enough to take a healthy gulp of wine. "I am a fine neighbor, but you, and I mean the royal you, Duke Robrecht, are not."

"Ugh, Robrecht as a name. Why it sounds simply ghastly, doesn't it."

"Your subject are the ghastly bits. Those little people who infest this land. With their grubbing in the dirt and milking of animals."

"Ah, taxpayers," said the Duke, "Yes, my Uncle says I am here to farm them."

"Herd them? Wouldn't herd be the word you're looking for?"

"Yes, I suppose it would. I am to herd them until tax time. And then I shear them and release them back into their fields."

"Look, dear man, it's not your sheep that are the problem. Nor your goats. The problem is the relents press of adventurers seeking to steal what they imagine is the vast repository of treasure stashed in my dungeon."

"You have treasure, Alston? All this time you've been holding out on me?"

"No, no, heavens no. I mean a little *family* money, but nothing to speak of. I am a Wizard, a researcher into the arcane and terrible forces that undergird all of our lives."

"Sounds rather dull to me."

"Well, it's not for everyone, but my work is *important*. Deucedly important. So much so that I've nearly isolated the source of all magic in this plane of existence."

"Plane of existence?" asked the Duke, wrinkling his face in confusion.

"Sorry, sorry, don't mean to trouble you with technical terms. The thing is, If I can harness this source, tap into the very essence, why I would be the most powerful and accomplished Mage in the history of the world."

"Prize for that is there?"

"No, Weeveston, there is not. Power is it's own reward."

"Ah, yes, well, you'd have to talk to my Uncle about that."

"But not on a hunting trip?"

"Oh, ho ho, quite so. Quite so."

"The point is, I keep getting interrupted in my work. I can't get anything done. And it's your fault."

"My fault?"

"Yes, the endless stream of mendicants, adventurers and ne'er do wells who seek to kill me and deprive me of property. To become rich heroes by defeating the Evil Wizard, that's what they want!" Here the Wizard grew less sure of himself, "I'm not an *evil* wizard, am I Weeaveston? I try not to be, but some days, God I just don't know."

"No, of course you are not an Evil Wizard. I've known you since grammar school. A touch mischievous, perhaps. But Evil? No."

"Oh, thank you for saying so. I do appreciate your honesty," said the Wizard. "At first I thought the adventurers would stop coming. You know, after most of the first wave of looters fell into my traps or afoul of my pets. But failure dissuaded no one. They doubled their efforts. And then redoubled them after that!

"Most died on the upper levels, but the few that managed to penetrate deeper into my stronghold, they've caused real damage. So I have been force to turn away from my important work to employ spies and turncoats,  fashion ever more diabolical traps and oversee the painful logistics of force management and deployment. I don't want any of this, it's a constant strain and a distraction from my work. I tell you Weaveeston, I am close to a deeper knowledge and understanding of the forces that shape our world than any man has ever had before."

The Duke fixed the Wizard with a look and said, "I know what force shapes our world, and sadly, it is heredity."

But the Wizard was on a roll. "And the power! The limitless power. It should be I that make this connection with the source. Lest this power fall into the hands of some truly EVIL wizard. So I'm afraid you simply must go. There's no other way I can see it."

"I would like nothing better than to comply with your wishes, old friend. But my Uncle would have me killed. Even if I did leave, it would do you no good, he would come in force and just take the Kingdom back. And it's not like it would solve your problem. I mean I can't very well take the sheep with me. Or stop members of the herd from seeking you out and troubling your in your research."

 "Yes, Weeveston, I suppose your right. I just -- you know, the long hours of study, the feeling of limitless power at one's finger tips. I just thought there must be some way to solve this problem."

"Of course, old boy. Perfectly understandable. Perhaps I could lend you some of my guards, to help ease the burden. But heavens knows my Uncle leaves me precious little enough to staff an army. Really more of a garrison. A bunch of drunks in helmets, honestly."

"Yes, I know, we all have our problems. I'm sorry Weeveston, I've been an ass. I've barged in unannounced, I've hit your man with Tilhphad's spell of Transformation. Threatened you with ultimatums. I swear Weaveeston, on my mother's grave, the soil of which is indispensable for the making of certain potions, I never wanted to be an Evil Wizard. A screeching, fire-throwing caricature of myself. But the world... the world will simply drive a man to it."

"Ah, hmm, yes." said the Duke. "You should meet my Aunt Etheline."

"Torvalds' wife?"

"Oh no, he had her killed long ago. Needlepoint "accident."" He has something of a penchant for killing relatives. No Etheline is his sister. And compared to him *she* is the *ruthless* one."

"Well, that makes me feel better."

"Better?"

"Yes, I would never do such a thing to my own family."

"Your extended family doesn't own and fight over estates and dominions that cover nearly a third of the known world."

"Perhaps you have a point. But *I* would draw the line at assassinating my own family."

"I do as well," said the Duke with an air of resignation, "But only because I don't have the means or talent to get away with it." 

"Oh and I should mention, I've dispatched a raiding party."

"Raiding party, well that doesn't sound so bad. I mean, it's understandable in a fit of temper and all. "

"Of Orcs,"

"Orcs? What are those?"

"They ride wolves, Weeveston. Wolves."

"Well whatever they are, they can't be very large if they are riding wolves."

"They are very large wolves."

"Yes, but what is a Horc?"

"No, no, good fellow, an Orc. No 'h'. They are my latest work. Terrible, terribly murderously bloodthirsty creatures. Stronger and faster than a man. Some cultivars have tusks, other do not. They all have greyish-green skin, almost impervious to weapons -- if not for the constant interruptions I would have gotten that bit right.

"Look, it's important that you know how badly I feel about this. Wiping out your entire Kingdom--" at the sound of the world Kingdom, the Duke flinched. "Oh, sorry, sorry, Duchy. Very sorry about that, didn't mean to rub it in.

"Anyway, I feel terrible about all of this old boy, really I do, but it seems the only way to get the peace in which I need to work."

"Well, I understand, you were upset, but it's just a raiding party. Probably do the old town some good. A little raiding. Till up the soil, attract more adventurers. Rallying to the cry of defend good ol' Robrecht!"

"No, no that's not the point. You see, old boy, I mean to drive you out. Work salt into the earth so nothing will ever grow here again."

"Wait, how many people in this raiding party? I mean how many of these Horks?"

"Orcs"

"…do you have?"

"Oh, a few thousand, by now I should say!"

"!h, well, why didn't you say so?" exclaimed the Duke, breaking out into a smile.

"What difference does it make?"

"Well if it two dozen our so, it would be a mere raiding party. But a thousand, perhaps two. Yes, two thousand?"

"I'm a wizard," said the Wizard, "Just not with numbers."

"Well, a quick look at the treasury will reveal that neither am I. But, anything over 500 is clearly an army."

"So?"

"Well, I wouldn't have abdicated, I would have been INVADED!"

"Yes."

"Well, for me it's no problem. I just slip away into the night. The warmth of exile in the Southern Kingdoms and the embrace of my wife --"

"Weeveston, you got married?"

"Oh, yes, for ages now. Arranged, but she is pleasant enough, as wives go. But she took one look at this damp tower and left me. She repaired to her father's estates in the south. Something about mold growing in her hair.

"But never mind that now. You have released me old friend. You have released me! I will instruct my household to pack at once."

"Probably for the best. The Orcs should descend on the town shortly after midnight."

"Oh, how very gruesome and terrifying."

"Yes, I thought it a nice touch."

"The only thing old boy," the Duke said, the smile dropping from his face, "Is my Uncle. He will take it hard. He will come for revenge."

"No worries, Weeveston. I can handle your Uncle Torvalds."

"I wish you would."

"As a favor to you, I am happy to do it," said the Wizard. The he said, "Bon Voyage!" gave a half-bow, and, in the way of Wizards, disappeared in puff of smoke. 

He appeared, quietly, with no smoke or fanfare, in the shadows of a warehouse building along the River Swift. That had gone surprisingly well, thought Dimsbury. It would have pained him to have killed his old grammar school mate Weeveston. Not much, but it is worth something to avoid even a momentary pang. To attack the city without resistance, well, that would mean his magnificent Orcs would not have their numbers greatly reduced by tonight's adventure. Pleased with himself, Dimsbury thought of turning his sights on the wider world. 

Ah, but ambition would wait until he had isolated the very source of magic. And this attack would grant him the peace and quiet in which he needed to work. One good long push at the end, and he felt confident he would have it within his grasp. Everything, really. For who could resist a man with limitless power in his grasp?

But tonight. A respite from his labors. His feed carried him south. He knew a of a place --  not the finest establishment, or even reputable by the standards of a privileged Mercian upbringing, it is true -- but he had been living on things grown in a cave. Slimy things prepared by clumsy creatures who did not possess a human palate. So it didn't take much to impress Dimsbury these days. 

Yes, a fine roast leg of lamb. Then a pleasant walk to a hilltop from which to watch the city burn. The only thing to regret was that would not have good company to enjoy such a delightful evening with. The sacrifices he made for his work were many.

Boltac dragged the unconscious Farm Boy out of his shop. As soon as the boy's feet were clear, he dropped him on the ground, and locked the front door. Boltac looked around, for a place to ditch the kid. Across the street, he saw an empty bench in front of the Bent Eelpout Tavern. Perfect, thought Boltac. He'll be just another drunk on a bench, sleeping it off.

As he dragged the lad across the street, Boltac muttered, "What were you thinking? Loan you a sword? Are you crazy? Well, of course you're crazy. Forget I asked" With much grunting, Boltac propped the lad up on the bench. He looked up at the hideous, twisted fish on the Tavern's faded sign and a longing for ale filled him. 

"Look kid," he said to the gently snoring Farm Boy on the bench, "It's for your own good. I mean, if you didn't see that coming, you're not going to see anything else coming. And that wasn't even tricky. You know what's tricky? Adventures are tricky." Boltac sighed heavily. "Believe me, go back to the farm."

Boltac watched the sleep. Now that the boy was he was unconscious he seemed even younger. "Okay, no charge for the concussion. And you're welcome," Boltac said. Then he went inside.


# 6 

"Asarah, my love!" Boltac bellowed before the door had even had a chance to close behind him, "I have come to rescue from all of this."

The hurried, hard-working, yet beautiful mistress of the Inn, turned away from a table she was clearing. When she saw who it was, the professional smile fell from her face and she asked, "And who's going to rescue you?"

Boltac climbed up on a bar stool, and said, "No, no. I mean it this time. I have come to sweep you away from all this pointless drudgery. We shall journey to a far kingdom where I am Lord and Master and you will be my Queen."

Asarah threw her thick, black mane of hair back from her face with her free hand. She walked behind the bar and, setting her hands on the well-worn wooden top, asked, "Whattya want Boltac?"

"Only you my love."

"Yeah, well, all you got is money. I ain't for sale. Now what are you having?"

"Asarah, can I borrow an ale?"

"What? Borrow an ale?"

"My point exactly!"

"Borrow?"

"Yes."

"Who asks such a thing?"

"Exactly!" said Boltac, pounding his fist on the bar. "Who asks such a thing? But people do. I swear to heaven they do. A young man, not 20 minutes ago, walked into my store and had the nerve to ask me if he could borrow a sword."

"What? You mean like you'd ask a neighbor to borrow a cup of sugar?"

"Yes, exactly. Except when you borrow a cup of sugar, you don't go off and use it to get yourself killed trying to save some damn fool... Priestess of Dar." 

"Oh, virgin love," she said as a mooney look crept into her eye.

"En-henh," said Boltac. "How about I just rent an ale?"

"Comin' right up." Asarah poured a tankard of ale out of the keg and set it on the bar in front of Boltac. Then she asked, "So, did you loan him the sword?"

"No," snapped Boltac, beer flying from his lips as his blissful first sip was interrupted by the memory of recent inanity. "I hit him over the head with a club, dragged him across the street and left him unconscious on the bench out front."

Now her eyes flashed dark against the wave of her hair. "How *could* you?" 

"It was easy, actually, I just took my... Look, woman, When you pick up a sword you pick up a lot of other things with it. And if the lad wasn't ready to deal with the ambush of a shopkeeper with a bad leg, then he certainly wasn't ready to deal with whatever dangerous and vile thing he meant to bash in the head of to preserve the honor of his wench."

"That word again. Wench. I thought you said she was a priestess?"

"Oh come on, it was a Sleeping Beauty. They were roping him."

"You don't know that. It could have been true love. True romantic love. The kind that you only hear about in songs."

"Yeah, you only hear about it in the songs, because ain't real."

"You're heart is only filled with money," said Asarah.

"No," said Boltac, "It's not full. There's room for more." Asarah rolled her eyes. "Besides, that's not the point. The point is my head is filled  with common sense. Say he's not being conned -- Which is unlikely, but what the hell -- so I give him the sword and he goes and gets himself killed. Enh, then that's on me and for what?"

But that's how she will know. The only way she can know!"

"Know what, that he's an idiot."

"The girl, she's in danger right?"

"I think it was something more along the lines of a fight for her honor, but sure, let's say she's in danger."

"Danger. She's been kidnapped, let's say. And she's being held captive at the bottom of horrible dungeon."

"Certainly are plenty of horrible dungeons around Robrecht," said Boltac, looking around the room as if he wished the subject would change itself. 

"It's so romantic. And he goes to rescue her and when he *does* rescue her that's how she *knows*."

"Eeeeyeah. You keep saying that. Knows what?"

"That he *loves* her. That he really, truly loves her above all others."

"That's how she'll know he's a muscle-headed idiot who's good with a sword."

"But he can't because some fat, greedy merchant wouldn't loan him a sword."

"No," said Boltac, pushing his anger back down, "I could loan him a sword and armor and everything else in my store. He can't because he DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO USE A SWORD!"

"Keep your voice down," hissed Asarah. You're disturbing the other patrons!"

"Patron," quipped Boltac across his empty tankard and gesturing at the nearly empty common room. 

Asarah slammed another ale down in front of him and said. "There's no romance in your life. No passion. No wonder you are alone. I feel sorry for you Boltac." And then she stormed off into the back. 

"Safer that way," Boltac muttered into his beer. 

Behind Boltac and an unseasonably cool wind filled the inn. Boltac turned to see who it was. A man in a black robe seemed to float across the common room as the door shut behind him. He took in the room with a raised eyebrow of disapproval then made his way to the bar. He sat and asked Boltac, "Do they have lamb tonight?"

"They usually do."

"Hmm, good. Good."

"So stranger, what business brings you to our fair city?" asked Boltac.

"Hmm, city?" asked the man, with shake of his head, "Ashtantis, that's a city. Squalipoor, Yorn, those are cities. This is a fish-drying village with delusions of grandeur."

"More like delusions of glory," said Boltac as he raised his ale, not sure he liked the other man's tone. "You have traveled then, a trader?" Asked Boltac, sniffing around for a profit. 

"More of a wandering scholar," said the man.

"What have you learned here," Boltac asked, sure that the man wasn't a scholar, but playing along anyway. 

"This dismal little inn serves the finest leg of lamb I have ever had."

On cue, Asarah emerge from the kitchen and gave Boltac a withering glare.

"You should tell her that," Boltac said. Asarah noticed the new customer at the bar and replaced her frown with a smile. 

"Madame, I have traveled many miles today, and all of them were in anticipation of the meal I hope to have at your establishment. Please, tell me you have made your incomparable lamb this evening."

Asarah's smile widened into one of true pleasure. She blushed and curtsied. "Well, I don't know about incomparable, but we have roasted lamb tonight."

"A leg if you please," said the man in black robes, "And an ale."

"Of course, it's a pleasure to serve such a refined customer," Asarah said, and smiled at him in a way that Boltac didn't like. Asarah slid the man his ale and hurried back to the kitchen. 

Boltac called after her. "Make that two." Without looking back Asarah threw him a dismissive wave over her shoulder."

For a moment, both men sat quietly with their ales. The man in black robes staring into space thoughtfully. Boltac staring at the door through which Asarah had just disappeared. 

The stranger broke the silence first. "What is an Eelpout?" 

"An Eelpout? You don't know what an Eelpout is?"

"I am, as they say, not from around here."

"Eeh, yeah, no doubt. So an Eelpout is, well, imagine an ugly fish."

The man in black did not change his expression. 

"Seriously, envision it in your head."

"I am."

"Oh, well, then it's nowhere near ugly enough. It's so ugly, this Eelpout, that to think of it is to -- "

"I have seen a great many ugly things," said the man in a way that indicated that he, the far worldlier man, was growing tired of this exchange. 

"But you've never seen an Eelpout, is what I'm saying."

"No."

"Ugliest Godsdamned fish in the world."

"And bent?"

"Drunk, I'd guess. Probably nothing uglier in the universe than an Eelpout on a bender."

"Then why would one name an establishment after such a creature."

"No idea," said Boltac. "Mystery of it all."

"Ah, mystery."

Asarah left the kitchen with a well-ladened tray. She threw another high-powered smile at the stranger as she slid a steaming trencher of lamb in front of him. "Your dinner, sir." When she turned to face Boltac, the smile slipped from her face. The slapped the plate in front of him, and delicious, savory meat juice splattered the front of Boltac's tunic. She turned and walked away without saying a word. 

The stranger swallowed his first bite and sighed with true contentment. "The only mystery, "Is why someone doesn't take such a talented creature away from all this."

Boltac's eyebrows lifted and only his mouth moved as he asked, "In the gentle words of the virgin Priestesses of Dar, come again?"

"Oh, nothing. It's just, such a rare creature. I wonder why she stays in this... squalor."

"Squalor? Buddy, I'm eatin' here."

"Oh, I meant no offense. It is what you are *used* to after all. "

"Eh, her husband owned this inn. He died and that's her hand of cards."

"Hmm," the stranger grunted, as he tucked into his dinner in earnest.

"So, uh, while we're asking questions, what's with the dismal garb, friend? If you are in the market for some more impressive threads, I have a fine store a few steps away."

"Ah, yes. A merchant. You would be. And as for the dismal garb, I prefer the term humble. I am a, uh, wandering scholar, in search of knowledge."
 
"Knowledge, here's something you can always count on -- Don't take any wooden nickels," Boltac said, trying to lighten the mood. 

"What's a nickel?"

"You don't know what a nickel is? Not much of scholar are you?"

"I'm not concerned with insignificant matters like trade and commerce."

"Enh, but still. You know clothes make the man."

"Ability makes the man."

"Yeah, that too. But nice clothes don't hurt, I'm just saying. My name is Boltac, by the way."

"Dimsbury," the man said, in way that irritated Boltac. A way that implied a title lurking somewhere in the wings. Who was he to put on airs? Here they were, both in The Bent Eelpout, one as good as another. If he was so high and mighty why wasn't he gnawing on mutton at the Duke's table? "Forgive me if I don't shake hands," Dimsbury concluding, sealing Boltac's judgment. 

Dimsbury finished the last bite of lamb and  threw a gold piece (more than 10 times enough for the bill) on the bar. He said, "See that she gets that, my good man. And ask her to bring me another ale over by the fire. Nothing personal," he said, with a thin-lipped smile, "I have a chill."

As he watched Dimsbury go, Boltac thought, "You brought it with you, ya rich prick." Then he muttered a prayer to the endlessly haggling Gods of commerce, "Just get me a chance to negotiate with that guy. He won't feel so high and mighty after that, I promise you." 

Since there wasn't an offer attached, the Gods of Commerce didn't hear his plea. But other, older Gods -- the ones in charge of punishing Hubris -- they heard Boltac's plea loud and clear.

When Asarah returned, and saw the coin on the bar. 

"What a fine gentleman he turned out to be!" she exclaimed, marveling at the gold piece.

"Oh yeah. Real prince of a guy. He said that's to cover mine too. And he wants another ale over by the fire."

Asarah stabbed him with her eyes, "So nice to have a quality customer for a change." 

Boltac held her gaze, "I'll get outta your hair."


> Linger for a bit to give Dimsbury some POV -- if we need to set up the kidnapping even further. 


# 7

Boltac slammed the door of the inn behind him, angry at Asarah for reasons he didn't fully comprehend. He looked up at the stars. He looked down at the muddy cobbles at his feet. Then he looked across the square to his store, trapped squarely between the two. Where he did not look was at the bench where the young lad, Relan sat unconscious. 

Damn what that woman thought. Her fool ideas of romance and heroism. Damn the world, for that matter. The boy was an idiot, and searching for death. No good to no one and a great deal of trouble to whomever he meant to poke with whatever sword he could beg, borrow or steal. That was the thing that all the would-be heroes forgot. The people they meant to stab to death in the name of glory thought that they were heroes too. 

In the end, observed Boltac, it wasn't even the heroes that got the worst of it. It was the people in the middle. The shopkeepers, the peasants, the simple folk just trying to get through the day. To make a buck, raise a crop or raise a family. 

This dark line of thinking served to steel Boltac's nerve so he could get across the square, but when the shop door closed behind him, his resolve faltered. He peered through the window at the boy he had knocked unconscious. For a moment, Boltac was worried that he had killed the lad. But after a moment the boy stirred a little in his sleep. 

Boltac remembered when he had been Relan's age. Young and strong and chained to store. As his father had been fond of saying, "Keep a shop and it will keep you." And so it did, keeping a young boy from doing anything that he might want to do in this world. Keeping him at endless, boring work that served as endless torture to a young man who craved adventure. 

He did not feel guilty for braining the lad. If it was Adventure the boy was after, he would have to withstand far worse. And if his younger self had appeared by magic before him in his own store Boltac would have done far worse. He would have tried to beat some sense into his former self. 

Why could't Asarah see the logic of that? Why did she never approve of any of Boltac's carefully negotiated ways. He craved her affection and approval more than he understood. But it was a thing of which he could not speak. Even to himself. Like the past.

There was no way to tell a young man of the hazards that awaited him. Of the costs to life and limb and family -- all the ways of hurt and all the ways those hurts could radiate beyond himself. It was a terrible thing to be a hero. And Boltac wished the pain of it on no one. And on  no one's family. 

But there was no way to frame the words, no order to put them in that could make it through a testosterone addled brain and overcome the lust for glory. If not this priestess con, the lad would find some other cause, or scrape or trouble. At least he wasn't off in search of that terrible Wizard that all of the other 'Adventurers' were always harassing. None of them ever seemed to come back. Who knew, maybe that meant the Wizard was real and terrible after all. 

No, Boltac realized, there was no stopping him. So why had he tried? Because he saw himself in the lad. And would have given anything and risked everything to take back the poor choices of his own youth. 

He spit and cursed the Bards. It was their fault. Putting all these ideas in young men's heads. Sending them off to war or in search of gold.  

Damn it all. He stomped to the sword barrel, He drew one of the blades and tested it's balance. Awful. He sighted the edge. I was as curved as an old whore's back. What an awful piece of workmanship. It was the kind of item he would willingly sell to a fool, but not the kind of weapon he would wish on his worst enemy. 

A man needed a sword he could trust. Boltac saw the shape of a terrible memory rising from the dark waters of his mind. Before the thought could fully take hold of him, slammed the sword back in the barrel. 

He walked to the rack of weapons. He removed the blade from the bottom. It was the one he would of chosen, if he were spending his own money. It was a stout, Mercian sword. At one end, it's straight blade came to a broad triangular point and the hilt was heavy round pommel that, in the hands of someone who knew what they were doing, qualified as a weapon on it's own. The blade sang softly as he unsheathed it and begged to dance in his hand. He sighted this weapon and it's hard edge was as crisp, final and unforgiving as the border between life and death.

There wasn't a soul on the streets as Boltac crossed the square. The stars seemed impossibly high and uncaring. When he got to the boy he hung the sword around Relan's neck very carefully, so as not to wake him. Underneath the thick head of straw blond hair, Boltac could see a freshly-risen lump. Ouch. He reached out to touch it. His fingers almost made contact. Then Boltac became self-conscious. He looked around as if he was afraid of being caught doing something wrong. But there was no one watching. 

He scuttled back across the square. 


# 8

Back in his shop, Boltac barred the door and retrieved the heavy lockbox from beneath the counter. It hadn't been a busy day, but in dribs and drabs the coins had piled up. A bit of lace here, a poultice there, it all added up to a nice living. 

He poured the coins out on the counter. Then looked out the window and across the square. The boy was there and still unconscious. Probably just a growing boy and needed his sleep, thought Boltac with a pang of guilt. Someone should get the kid in off the street, or else he might lose that sword Boltac had just given him. 

For a second, Boltac thought about going and getting it back, but thought better of it. If Asarah came out and saw the kid with the sword, it would go half-way to getting Boltac back in her good graces. But if she came out and caught Boltac taking the sword back, ergh, she'd never forgive him for that. She was probably too busy fawning over that slumming aristocrat to tear herself away. Throwing gold coins away like it was nothing. Who did he think he was? Coins were for being careful with. For counting, for hoarding, for saving for a rainy day. 

Boltac divided the coins on his counter into three piles of gold, silver and copper. He quickly counted the copper coins and made a note of them in his ledger. With the silver coins he took more time. He used a set of weights and measures to make sure that not only the count was accurate, but also the total weight. 

Boltac was very careful not to take any coins that had been clipped, or were too light to be pure. With copper, clipping was rarely a problem. The coins just weren't worth enough to be worth the trouble. With silver clipping became a problem, but that was spotted easily enough. It was the gold coins that presented the greatest difficulty for Boltac. 

Gold was worth enough that instead of merely clipping it, it was worth the time and trouble it took to dip lead in gold to create a coin that seemed like gold, but was worth less than silver. This presented a problem for a shrewd merchant who did not want to be taken advantage of. It was insulting to test a customer's coin on the spot yet painful to take a loss. 

Boltac grabbed a small glass dish and bottle labeled Aqua Fortis from a shelf beneath the counter. He carefully poured liquid from the bottle to  the dish. He picked up one of the gold coins, dipped it in the liquid, then examined it carefully. If it had turned green, it would have been a sign that the coin was some alloy, or plated lead. But the gold remained it's reassuring yellow color. With a satisfied grunt, he placed the coin on the other side of the dish. 

He tested one coin and the next, pleased to find that all of them were real. He picked up the second to the last gold coin of the day and lowered it into the acid. The coin did not turn green. It did not smoke. It did not sizzle or emit a smell like rotten onions. Instead, it hissed, came to life and bit his hand. 

Boltac cursed and threw the evil little coin across the room. Then he immediately regretted it. With surprising speed for a fat man, he scrabbled out from behind the counter in pursuit. 

There, in the middle of the floor, he saw the gold coin sprout thin, insect-like legs and scrabble for purchase against the boards. Boltac tried to stomp it and missed. He stomped again and again, hopping through his store, knocking items here and there in a strange sort of destructive dance. 

The coin scrambled under a rack of rope and strips of leather. With a roar, Boltac kicked the rack over and brought his booted foot squarely down upon the creature. 

"HA!" he cried in triumph. He shambled to the other side of the room, dragging his foot as he went, grinding the creature across the floor, until he was able to reach a set of pliers hanging on the wall. Then he bent down and, ever-so-carefully, clamped the edge of the angry, savage coin in the teeth of the pliers. It let out another metallic shriek, but Boltac was unmoved by it's pain. 

He carried the coin into the back, past the foul-smelling bundle of gear he had purchase from Rattick and to a set of iron-bound chests that were sealed with fearsome-looking locks and bolted to the floor. The one on the right had a hole in the top of it, sealed with a piece of cork. He removed the cork, crammed the coin into the hole -- having to hit it several times with the hammer to convince it to go in -- and then replaced the cork. He put his ear to the chest and waited until he heard the "clink" of coin-creature settle down.

Only after the creature was contained, did Boltac look to his hand. A fingernail-sized disc of flesh was missing from his palm and blood leaked down his forearm. Damned coin. He kicked the chest and immediately regretted it. The chest didn't move and all he got for his trouble was a hurt foot. A bad trade. Boltac looked up and smiled. 

Hanging from a nail on the wall above the chests was a small silver whistle. He grabbed it with his uninjured hand and blew on it for all he was worth. Such a furious, shrieking commotion erupted from inside the chest that for a moment, Boltac worried that the chest might burst. He imagined the hundreds of coins in the cramped, dark space -- all angered -- all clawing at each other in fury and he smiled. 

Boltac had named these treacherous pieces of currency the Creeping Coins. At one time, he had thought to train them to perform, as he had seen traveling mummers train fleas, snakes, monkeys and even bears. But they were either untrainable or Boltac had lacked the knack of it. For all his time and experiments he had only earned a number of bite scars and the knowledge that a certain, high-pitched frequency drove these Creeping Coins mad. 

Who had created these creatures, and why? Boltac had been unable to find out. What he had learned was that they were a species of magical creature that preferred to stay unseen. So they had a most sinister method of reproduction. If you placed one of these magic coins in a pile of regular coins, they would slowly but surely convert all of the real coins to animated hunks of metal with sharp little teeth. One at time, they were an annoyance. But in the depths of a dungeon, amid a chest full of gold that might not be opened for years? These creature could turn a payday into a nightmare. Boltac hated to even imagine what that would be like. 

He rubbed a healing ointment into the fingernail-sized bite in his hand. It stopped the bleeding, but did nothing for the pain. What would a school of these things do? Or just a few of them under a suit of armor. He shuddered. At least death by Dragon would be quicker and cleaner. 

But that's the way it was with any enterprise. People feared the big things, but it was always the little things that did you in. The demons were in the details, as they said. All the work you spent polishing your shield in preparation for a Basilisk, could all go wrong if you forgot to bring oil to protect it from rust. 

It was a terrible business, adventuring, which was another reason why Boltac was glad he had grown up, settled down and learned to enjoy a warm fire and a crisp profit. Again, he tried to convince himself that had done that lad a favor by knocking him on the head.

As Dimsbury sat with his feet by the fire, it took him a good hour to give a name to what he was feeling. Contentment didn't quite do it. Comfortable was part of it, but there was something else. A warmish feeling in the stomach that he was quite unaccustomed to. There was something about a good meal after a good day's work. His plans all in order, everything tilting and tending the way it should. Sated, yes, that was the word he was looking for. He was Sated. 

For a moment he considered ordering another whole dinner. But there was no time. He had completed his errand and should really leave the city before the carnage started. But perhaps he should take a leg of mutton to go. Or -- did they have such a thing -- some mutton sandwiches?

It was so hard to get good food at the bottom of a dungeon. Yes, he had servants, but they were creations. Not flesh and blood. They viewed roasting as an information-gathering technique, or at best a method of discipline, not as essential part of cuisine. And spices? Well, the ones that needed to eat, ate raw flesh. It was practice guaranteed to keep a palate in an unrefined state. 

None of this even touched on the horrid nature of his decor and living conditions in general. Of course, the Wizard could have taken some pains on his own behalf, but there was his work to think of. All else paled in comparison to that. But here, even in this relatively homely inn, the Wizard felt a longing for the comfort he had almost forgotten he could have. A woman's touch, yes, that was the phrase. 

When the wench came around again, he asked, "Do you make sandwiches? You know, to go."

"My sandwiches are so good, men have proposed to me after the first bite," said Asarah with a playful toss of her hair. 

Outside, a wolf howled.

"What was that?" Asarah asked, her smile not falling away, but becoming tainted with concern. 

She had a nice smile, and the Wizard thought it was all the sweeter for being mixed with fear. Oh yes, thought the Wizard, he would definitely by taking something to go. "It sounded like a wolf," he said with exaggerated innocence, "I'd like two mutton sandwiches," he said with a smile.

"Lettuce and Tomato?" asked Asarah.

"However you like them."

"Well, you could just enjoy the hospitality of the Bent Eelpout and take fresh ones with you in the morning. Evidently, there are wolves about."

The Wizard smiled again. "But what assurance do I have that it will still be here in the morning."

"What, the sandwich?"

"No, the Inn."


# 10


When Boltac heard the howl, he looked up and out the front window. Across the square he saw the boy, still sleeping in the moonlight. He stood there, motionless for a moment, with the last gold coin clamped in his pliers. After getting bitten, he was taking no more chances. All coins were now guilty until proven innocent.  

The peaceful scene outside his window did not change, so Boltac  shrugged and touched the coin to the acid. It did not come to life and attack him, so he dropped it in the pile with the others. 

He poured the acid back into the bottle and wiped down the counter. Then he gathered up the coins and carried them into the back. He placed them in the other chest, the one that held the normal coins. Then turned his attention to the pile of soiled goods he had purchased from Rattick. 

He caught the flash of something out of the corner of his eye.He looked up and out the front of the store. There was a flash of grey by the window. And then again. 

Boltac walked forward slowly. He had no idea what was going on, but pretty sure that he didn't like it. It was out of the ordinary. And anything out of the ordinary was bad for business. In the distance he heard someone sound a horn? Then, he thought he could hear a woman scream. Or maybe it was a horse? What was going on? 

When he stepped outside the square was as empty. To the North, across the river, he saw the red glow of fire. Ah, thought Boltac, Raiders. He knew this game all too well. He had hoped, for once, that the Duke's garrison was strong enough to keep the raiders out, or that his rule could have lasted a little bit longer. But the tariffs and taxes from a crossroads town like Robrecht were valuable. And all the nobles of the world passed it back and forth like a toy. 

Now they weren't even pretending to install a King anymore. Robrecht had been pillaged so many times it didn't even get to keep the illusion of  being it's own kingdom. Now it was a mere protectorate. "En-henh," Boltac grumbled. There was not much protection to be had in being a protectorate. 

Maybe if the Duke had released his tax collectors on the invaders. That might do it. Boltac shook his head and went inside. He pulled his stool out from behind the counter and set to loading crossbows. Just let them come for his, thought Boltac grimly, and they would find the prices very, very high indeed.  

Across the square, he watched as Dimsbury emerge from the Tavern holding a two sandwiches wrapped in parchment. 

"Heh," said Boltac, "They come across the river and this prick is sure in for a surprise." 

Dimsbury noticed the Relan, still asleep on the bench. He looked him up and down. Then he nudged the lad with his toe. 

"Some adventurer." muttered Boltac, "He doesn't even wake up! Did I ever do that kid a favor."

Dimsbury reached into his pocket and produced a whistle. When he put it to his lips and blew it produced a slightly lower note than the whistle Boltac had used on the coins. He sounded the note three times, and then waited. 

Boltac heard them coming before he saw them. It sounded like a crowd of people saying something like, "Hork, Hork, Hork, Hork!" From the darkness, they rode into view on wolves. The largest wolves Boltac had ever seen. And they were barely tame. As they advanced they snarled and snapped at at each other and their riders. 

Whistles, thought Boltac, I knew they did it with whistles!

Boltac shrank back from the window, as one of the wolves sniffed at it and fogged the glass. What in the Gods' name were they? And the men that rode on their backs? They seemed more animal than man. Their greyish, green skin, looked thick, as if it they should have scales, but someone had forgotten. Their evil little eyes were set too close together. Their proportionally small mouths were overflowing with teeth, and gave the impression they would gnaw messily rather than chew. They had large, wide noses and pointed ears set high on their heads. 

"Ah," thought Boltac, "These would be Orcs." There was no way Rattick had fought one of these things. And there was no way they wore jewelry. Maybe a necklace made of ears, but not expensive rubies. 

The Orcs converged on Dimsbury. For a moment Boltac thought the wolves would tear the man's face off. But then Dimsbury said something and the growls and snarls changed to frightened whimpers. Two of the Orcs dismounted and their wolves ran away.

The Orcs turned as if to chase after their mounts, but a sharp bark from the Dimsbury stopped them. Who was this man who commanded monsters? Boltac wondered.

Boltac sighted his crossbow on Dimsbury, and then thought better of it. After all, he wasn't involved in this transaction. He should stay calm, keep his head down and hope they passed his store by. That was the surest way to avoid a loss in this situation. At least that's what his head told him. But his heart offered a different commentary when he saw the two Orc's kick in the door of the Bent Eelpout. 

Asarah!

She'd be fine, Boltac told himself. A strong woman, used to dealing with unruly customers. She had come through raids before. She'd be fine. Dimsbury dismissed the remaining, still mounted Orcs. The, whattya call a bunch of Orcs anyway? thought Boltac. A troupe, a band, a herd, a gaggle. The rest of them rode South. 

With a crossbow in the crook of his right arm, not taking his eyes from the square, he eased back to the weapons rack and grabbed a double-headed axe without looking at it. He asked himself, "What are you doing?" The voice in his head answered, ""You're not gonna do anything stupid. You're a merchant, not a hero. She'll be fine. You're no help to anybody dead." He placed the axe, head down, beneath the windowsill, next to the other crossbow. 

Across the square, he saw the two Orcs emerge from the Inn holding Asarah between them. She struggled against them and cursed. "Think she is still going to be okay?" he asked the voice in his head. It did not answer. Dimsbury turned to look at her and she spit on him. Then Dimsbury raised his hand and struck her across the face. Knocked sideways from the blow, Asarah struggled to bring her head upright again and roll her hair out of her face. Dimsbury stood with his back to Boltac's store, so he could not see his face. But whatever expression the unpleasant man wore, when Asarah saw it she started screaming.

Something broke inside of Boltac. Before he knew what he was doing, he had fired both crossbows and was charging out the door with the axe in hand. The first crossbow bolt took the Orc on the Asarah's left in the throat. The second hit the other Orc in the shoulder. 

Asarah screamed a plea and a question, "Boltac?"

But the Boltac she knew was no longer there. The rational, calculating, cunning merchant who stuck his neck out for nobody was not the same creature who lungs burned and heart pumped as his feet churned the dirt of the street. That Boltac was lifting the axe and imagining it cleaving Dimsbury from neck to breastbone. That Boltac didn't hear it coming until it was too late. 

If it had been a man on a horse riding him down, he would have heard him coming from a week away. But the pads of a wolf on the cobblestones? He  realized his mistake when it was too late. The wolf's fangs sank into his shoulder and lifted him from the ground at a dead run. "HORRRRRRRRRRRRRRK!" cried the triumphant orc. 

In pain and with animal rage, Boltac slashed blindly with the axe. He felt the edge sink deep into the wolf's neck. He heard it grunt in pain. The pressure in his shoulder went away as the wolf let go. Wolf, Orc and Shopkeeper tumbled across the cobblestones and landed in heap. Somehow, Boltac had kept his grip on the axe. 

In a haze, he watched Asarah struggling with Dimsbury. She was shouting, but the only thing Boltac could hear was the pounding of his own heart. He pulled himself from beneath the wolf, tried to stand and failed. His knee folded sideways underneath him. The pain from the second fall was worse than the first. Clutching the axe, he started to crawl.

Behind him, the Orc got to his feed and recovered his pike. He cocked his head sideways at this strange man crawling towards Master. Then he lifted his weapon and went to finish him. 

"Hold!" commanded Dimsbury. The Orc stayed the final blow. 

"My, my, my, you are determined," said Dimsbury with an air of amusement that made Boltac hate him all the more. "You are something more than a merchant, I think," said the Wizard. Boltac said, "en-henh" and kept crawling. 

"Boltac, what are you doing?" asked Asarah. Boltac could not answer because he was fighting off a wave of pain. But still he crawled. He was oblivious to the pike above his head, and only aware of Dimsbury's expensive boots in front of him. He was going to cut the bastard's feet off and then see where it went from there. 

Dimsbury shook his head at the poor spectacle beneath him. A fat merchant, crawling to his death as the hot stuff of life trailed on the cobbles behind him. How was it that the poor merchant's arm had not been completely severed? He turned to his prize, "Come my dear, let me take you away from all of this."

"Let me go!" she cried, "I must to tend my Inn."

"Ah, yes," said Dimsbury. He waved his hand without taking his eyes from her and the front of the Bent Eelpout was engulfed in flame. 

Asarah screamed again. 

"Please," said the Wizard, "refrain from screaming in my ear." To the Orc he said, "Finish him." He gripped Asarah around the waist and held her to him. Before she could stubble, he took flight and disappeared straight up into the night with her. 

Boltac struggled to his knees and reached after her. 

The Orc brought the butt end of his pike down on Boltac's back and knocked him to the ground. Boltac heard some of his ribs separate from his spine. He thought that was bad, until the Orc kicked him in those ribs. His world went white with pain and he rolled over onto his back. 

This was it. The Orc spun the pike and touched him gently on the nose with the point. Then lifted the pike into the air for the coup de grace.

And then, in that final moment, Boltac discovered that he wasn't afraid. He wasn't even angry. His last thought was of Asarah, and he was sad. Sad that he would never get to see her again. Sad that he would never again get to play the game of cheating her out of a drink, or drive her mad with his haggling, or marvel at the way her hair would bounce and turn like a living thing as she worked her way through the common room of her inn.

At times like these, ordinary men try negotiating with death. They Offer every promise, pledge and advantage they can think of in exchange for life. But Boltac was not an ordinary man. And certainly not an ordinary negotiator. At that moment he realized that his life alone was not worth negotiating for. If was to haggle with fate, it would not be for his life, it would not be for his store or his fortune. Boltac was surprised to discover that, in the final accounting, those things were worth nothing to him. The only thing worth negotiating for was life, with *her*. Without her, he couldn't seem to come up with a reason to bother.   

As if in a dream, he watched two feet of steel emerge from the Orc's belly. The pike fell, not on Boltac's head, but next him on the muddy street. As the Orc's body fell away to the side, Boltac saw the Relan standing there, trying to hold the Orc up with the sword Boltac had given him. No scream of victory echoed from the boy's throat. Instead he looked at the blood and the blade and the corpse that was dragging his hand towards the ground as if he couldn't quite understand what had just happened. "That blade is a quality item," Boltac explained. Then he passed out. 


11

Relan was so terrified, he left the sword in the Orc. 

"Mister? Mister? What do I do."

"Henh?" said Boltac, wondering why he wasn't being left to die in peace. Then he realized that he wasn't dead yet, just in a tremendous amount of pain. "The store, get me to the store."

"Okay, I can do that."

"Good kid. I'm gonna pass out now." But as soon as the mule-strong farmboy started dragging him across the cobbles, the pain of his injuries brought him back to consciousness. "Ahhhhh, AHHHH!"

"Sorry," said Relan.

"Don't apologize. Just draAAAAAAAAAHag!" Boltac passed out from the pain .

When Relan got Boltac into the store and propped him up against the counter, Boltac came around enough to say, "Take the keys. In the back, the chest on the left. Very important, only open the chest on the LEFT. Bring me the bottle."

"Which bottle?"

"The *only* bottle. And hurry up. I'm dyin' here!"

"The only bottle. Right"

Relan hurried to the back. Fear caused him to fumble with the lock. And drop the keys. He had never seen that much blood come from a person before. And that thing he had stabbed out there. What was that? He'd never really thought about it. He woke up and saw it about to kill the merchant. There was sword in his lap. There had been no time, he had just done what needed doing. 

He dropped the keys, again. He never thought it would be anything like this. They sure didn't sing about this part. What if more of them came? What if they could smell blood. What if they were coming to the shop right now. Had he shut the door? And if he had shut the door, did he remember to bar it? He was confused and his head really, really hurt. 

He opened the chest. Inside were many leather bags filled with coins. Ye gods, how many coins were in here? Tucked in a corner was a cut-glass glass bottle with the stopper wired shut. It seemed very old and the edges of the bottle were painted with gold leaf. Relan picked it up very carefully. Drop the keys all you want, he told himself, but don't drop this bottle. 

He carried it out to where Boltac sat propped up in a pool of his own blood. As he handed it to him, he heard a buzzing as if an angry hive of bees was close by and with it, the smell of burning wood. "Gods," Relan exclaimed, "Flaming bees!"

"Shut up, kid," Boltac said weakly, "It's magic. Undo the wire."

Relan did as he was asked. Boltac held the bottle in his left hand and took the cork out with his teeth. He spit it across the room. He raised the bottle in a toast and said, "Listen, kid, if I don't make it. All this…" he indicated the store he had worked so hard to build, "You don't take a single friggin' thing you understand? I wanna be buried with *all* of it."

Up until that point, Relan hadn't thought of stealing. It wasn't what heroes did, so it wasn't what Relan would do. But now he couldn't help himself, as Boltac drank the bottle he looked around. But when Boltac screamed in pain, Relan's attention snapped back to the shopkeeper. 

Boltac writhed and arched his back arched at a frightful angle. There was a snapping and popping noise as his knee twisted back into place on it's own. Sweat poured from Boltac's face as he spiked a fever and broke it in less than a minute. A wave of nausea came, and then a sense of calm. The ragged wound in his shoulder spit out a wickedly curved tooth and closed. 

"Wh-wh-wh-what was that?" Relan asked in amazement. 

"That," Boltac said, the snap returning to his voice, "was a *magic* potion. The genuine article. Most of what I sell is herbs and healing tonics, and a couple of smelly poultices made by this old crone out in one of the villages. I won't say they're garbage, but, uh, you slap a poultice on serious wound. Ya gonna die."

"Do you have any more?" Relan asked with wide eyes. Thinking that carrying a few of those potions with him would be an antidote to the fear that was still causing his limbs to shake. 

"Ah, no. Very rare. Very expensive. Help me up."

Boltac tried his recently mangled leg. It felt good. In fact, it felt better than he could remember it ever feeling. 

"Are you okay?" asked the Relan.

"En-henh."

"What are you going to do?"

"What am I going to do?" Boltac thought hard. Set his jaw, narrowed his eyes and then fell dead asleep. 


# 11

When Boltac awoke, he was in his bed with bright light streaming in through his window. He returned to consciousness slowly and from a great distance. At first he couldn't remember how he had gotten here, or what had happened. Then, as the memory of it flooded back, he became fearful. Unable to separate fantastic dream from terrible reality, he flung back the covers. His leg was straight. His shirt was ripped, but the skin underneath was perfect and unscarred. That really had been a *magic* potion. Hell of a way to find out. 

He got out of bed and stretched. Then he went downstairs. 

At the foot of the narrow stairs, he found Relan asleep in a pile of cloaks. Even in his sleep he clutched the sword the Boltac had given him. Boltac nudged him with his boot and jumped back.

"Ahh!" screamed Relan awaking with a start. When he that it was Boltac  he said, "I was standing guard. In case those things came back."

"No kid, that's sleeping guard." Boltac softened a little, "But, uh, I appreciate it." Boltac stepped over the boy and brought out a loaf of thick black bread and some butter. "C'mon, breakfast."

They ate in silence for a while. Relan asked, "What were those things?" 

"Evidently, what you killed was an Orc."

"An Orc?"

"An Orc," Boltac said with a shrug, to indicate that he wasn't the guy making the rules. 

"So they were bad," said Relan.

"Yeah, kid, they were definitely bad."

"So, are we going to go get them?"

"We? No. I'm not going to go get them? That's why I pay taxes."

"But that Evil Wizard took the woman you love?"

"Love is a strong word to use, for a pleasant association. Besides, I'm a merchant, not a fighter."

"If you're not in love with her, then why did you charge out of your store to save her?"

"I, uh, hey, look, it's complicated. 

"And for a somebody who's not a fighter, you managed to kill two Orcs."

"And a wolf," said Boltac, shaking his head. 

"That's pretty good."

"That's only because you suck," snapped Boltac. 

"Suck or not, I'm going after that Wizard. Somebody has to do the right thing."

"Kid, the right thing to do is almost always to keep your head down and make a buck."

"That sounds like something a coward would say."

"Eh-henh. It's the kind of thing the living says. Get this, I was very stupid. And am lucky to be alive. So I'm not going to push my luck. Besides, this kind of thing is why I pay taxes. Let the guards deal with this."

"You're a coward," said Relan.

"Whattya want from me? I'm a merchant. I ain't no hero." 

"Well why would anybody want to be that?" asked Relan, "If the whole world was merchants, nobody would have saved your life."

"Look, I'm grateful for that. It's not like I'm not grateful. So, uh, as a reward. Take what you like from the store -- as much as you can carry without horse or wagon -- and then go to your death. Have fun. Me, I'm going to see the Duke and see what he's gonna do about all this. See if he can get my Innkeeper lady friend back."

Relan shook his head and took another bite of bread.

Outside, smoke hung thick in the air. Everywhere there were signs of carnage, The Bent Eelpout and most of the other side of the street had burnt to the ground. Boltac saw the dead wolf and orcs, but did not linger over them. 

On his walk North, he passed serval bodies body lying in the street. One was a young girl, maybe nine. Her pretty dress was torn and soaked with blood. Boltac looked away and muttered, "Bad for business."

As he crossed the bridge to the keep, he expected to see a line of petitioners. But there was no one. Not even a guard at the gate. The court should be full with angry citizens demanding redress and protection. The walls should have been decorated with Orc's heads on pikes. By now he should have been able to hear wounded members of the Ducal guard drinking by the stables. Their laughter and the stories of their bravery should have carried over the wall. There should have been smoke from the blacksmith, and the sound of weapons being sharpened. 

But there was nothing. 

In the courtyard he passed the royal carriage standing all alone. It looked like someone had abandoned it in haste. From the stable he heard the whinny of a horse. 

Boltac pushed his way into the keep through the half-opened front door. There was no one in the antechamber. There was no one anywhere. Every room he checked was empty. As if all the people had vanished. He called out, but only the echo of his own hello answered. 

When he reached the empty throne room. The penny dropped. Mostly, it was the tapestry flapping in a wind that shouldn't be there. Behind the heavy, musty, overly stylized scene of a heroic battle that had probably never happened, Boltac found a secret door. 

As he descended down and down through narrow stone passageways until he finally emerged at a set of docks in a high walled cove on the north side of the island. All the boats were gone, but discarded items were everywhere. Over there was a guard's helmet and at his feet was chest of silks. He could almost see the scene as it had happened. 

A guard rushing to herd the Duke's household onto the boats. To get them down the River Swift before the attack came. A lady-in-waiting trying to bring this ridiculous chest of frippery. "No, woman, we don't have room for your damn silks,"" the guard would have snapped, perhaps knocking the chest from her hands as he shoved her roughly into a boat. 

Then he would have jumped in himself, and pushed the boat free of the docks. The water would have taken them South quickly, and if they survived the an uncomfortable ride through the rapids, they would already be out of the grey, misted-covered mountains of Robrecht and enjoying a leisurely ride to Shatnapur, the Northernmost city in the Southern Kingdoms. Odds are they were free and clear, floating down a river with the sun in their faces. 

The guards would know how close they came, but the nobles -- the soft and careless ones that claimed privilege to rule -- would be thinking of  what Southron delicacies they might feast upon in a few days times. Rare  tropical fruits. The brains of monkeys. Anything delectable and procured at great suffering to the peasantry. What they weren't thinking about, Boltac knew, was the body of a young girl, dead in a gutter. 

Boltac spit in the river, then headed headed back up the stairs. 

Back in the throne room, he tried to wrap his head around it. There was no one. They had *all* gone. At the first sign of danger, the Duke had fled. Boltac walked to the throne and sat down. For a second, he almost took it seriously. Then he laughed hysterically at himself. 

This wasn't the chair for him. He was a merchant. Everyone knew you couldn't buy a throne. Of course, such a thing could be inherited. But somewhere, some way, somebody had to win a throne with a sword. A sword drenched in blood. An illiterate barbarian could sooner be a King than a fat merchant. And it had been so long since Robrecht had a real King. Or anything other than a figurehead installed by a larger, more powerful Kingdom seeking to control the trade routes. 

The health of Kingdoms, thought Boltac, did not depend on war, but commerce. The opportunity for everyone to be able to conduct their business in peace is what made people happy and productive. But the only people deemed fit to rule were warriors and their inbred descendants. Something was wrong with this logic. But it was not for him to fix. 

Boltac heaved himself off the fancy chair and left the room. From the wall of the castle he saw heavy columns of smoke rising from the north end of the town. In two's and three's people he could see people fleeing from the North gate. To the south, the damage was less, but there was a larger stream of traffic. People were leaving? Was this the way it was to be? Was this how his town died? 


# 13


By the time he got back to the store, Relan was gone. Boltac's practiced shopkeeper's eye quickly saw what the boy had taken. All the wrong things. The idiot was probably even walking. Walking to his heroic death. 

Boltac thought about opening for business. He thought about barricading the store against looters. Then he looked across the street to the still smoldering remnants of the Bent Eelpout. He stared for a long time. He stared until a light rain began to fall. He watched the drops turn to steam as soon as the hit the smoldering coals of what used to be an inn. Each drop was infinitesimal. Wasted. A single drop could not put out a fire. But enough water could wash an entire city away. He savored his melancholy and rolled this thought around for a while. Then he turned his back on the window.  

Boltac looked around his store. The kid had taken all the wrong things. And what's worse, it appeared he had taken the wrong things to carry them in. Boltac shook his head. Why travel if you don't the luggage you need to enjoy the journey?

He had sold a lot of luggage with that line, but it didn't stop if from being bad advice. 

He went into the back and open the chest on the left. He took out all of the small leather bags filled with coin and se them aside. He would need money, or course. After all, it was the most multipurpose substance known to man, but, for Boltac's purposes, there was something in here more valuable than money. 

"Ah HA!" as he held up a a burlap brown sack that looked like it's only purpose in life was to hold 20 pounds of potatoes. "There you are," Boltac said to the sack as if was a precious child that he had found in a game of hide and seek. Of course, this was a ridiculous analogy -- Boltac hated children -- but this burlap sack? He couldn't have been more proud of this sack. 

He walked through his well-stocked store and placed items he might need for his journey into his sack. Into it's modest opening he placed five goat skins of water, two of wine, 10 stout torches, a few flagons of the finest oil, three daggers, an axe, an ornate and well-jeweled mace in a wooden case, a roll of rare tools used for the picking of locks and dismantling of doors and chest, several hundred feet of good rope, an extra pair of boots, two hats, several wool blankets, a lambswool sweater (the depths could be cold) a side of pork cured in salt, five pounds of hard biscuit and a pound of chocolate. 

But that wasn't all. He flitted here and there between the shelves, adding this and that and the other, oddments and ointments, anything Boltac thought he might need in the depths of some foul, unknowable place. Because, if there was one thing that Boltac knew about adventure,  it was that you never knew, or could know, what was going to happen. 

The second to last thing to go in was the magic lantern. And last of all, were his thick gloves of magic negation. Didn't want to be reaching around in a bag like that with bare hands, that was for sure. 

Through all of this, the bag never bulged, or grew heavier than the 17 or 20 pound that a sack that size, filled with potatoes, could be expected to weigh. The more Boltac has stuffed into the sack the wider he had smiled. For an instant, he considered trying to fit EVERYTHING in to the sack, just to see if it would take it, but he thought better of it. Even a magic sack had to have it's limits. And if it didn't, that wasn't the kind of thing Boltac wanted to know. 

Boltac hated magic, but he loved this bag. It was Themistres Bag of Holding. One of only a very few known to exist. It was said that it would contain anything the owner could place into it. It never got heavier or bigger. It was, in effect, a bottomless bag. 

Themistres, as the story went, made the bag for his wife. She was a large woman who liked to travel heavy. The Wizard had not made many of them and no Wizard seemed to have been able to duplicate his feat. Wizards seldom married, and the ones who did, generally wound up turning their wives into something that wouldn't bother them. The Bag of Holding was generally believed to be a myth -- a pleasant fiction of overloaded husbands and servants everywhere. But Boltac had found one. And what a wondrous thing it was. Priceless, really. 

With this thought of pricing, he remembered the coins left out in the back. He took out his gloves. Put them on. Removed the magic lantern, which now did not light as he touched it. Then, he added some gold. As he did, Boltac thought, why hold some in reserve? It wasn't like he expected to be coming back. And that's when Boltac realized -- told the truth of it to himself -- he probably wasn't going to make it out of this adventure alive. 

He stopped, and stood up in the back room of his store. The store he had worked so hard to build into a thriving business. Standing among the money he had worked so hard to save. And all of it seemed so worthless now. The heavy weight of the mittens of magic negation dragged his hands   towards the floor and his shoulders stooped. For a moment, tears ran down his round, weathered face. He let out one sob. Then sniffed, then bent back to the task at hand. 

He piled *all* the gold into the sack. Who knew, perhaps he could buy his way out of this trouble? That was what a shrewd merchant would do. 

When he picked up the lamp this time, even though he was still wearing the gloves, it shone as brilliant and pure as the first rays of sunrise.  For better or worse, Boltac was ready.  


Boltac left the store and headed North, for points unknown and unknowable. Yes, it was stupid. But there was nothing else to do. In the end, he had no more choice than a single raindrop falling onto the smoldering remains of a burned building. But that didn't mean he didn't have any choices. It had been a mistake to try fight like a hero. Boltac could see that now. He wasn't a hero. He wasn't a King either. But he wasn't powerless. Rather than go off half-cocked, he could use the skills and tools he had. He could do a better job of outfitting himself. And he would be damned if he would be *walking* to his death.


# 14

Relan was wearing a new pair of boots. In fact, it was his first pair of boots. Up until this point he had only worn sandals or wooden shoes. And then, they were mostly hand-me downs. Everything in Relan's life had been a hand-me down. That's the way it was when you were the youngest of  seven on a cold-water farm hidden away in the fog-shrouded mountains of Robrecht. There was plenty of work and nothing else. 

But if they could see him now?

Over a linen shirt, he wore a shirt of shining chain mail (not the best mail that Boltac had, but the best-looking.) Around his neck a cloak made of hammered felt was clasped with a chain of silver. On his hip, the sword Boltac had given him swung from a wide leather sword belt. On his opposite hip was a dirk with it's handle worked into the shape of a screaming eagle. Pants of the finest, softest deer skin he had ever encountered were tucked into the black boots with high cuffs and silver buckles. This is how a hero should look, he thought. 

Oh they had laughed at him on the farm -- well, his older brothers and sisters had, Ma and Pa had been too tired. They took the news of his departure as they took all news, good or bad. With the tired stare of someone who has seen the worst that the seasons and the ways of man has had to offer, and, from long habit, tried not to get excited one way or another. 

"You'll be back," his eldest brother had said, in imitation of the same hard, bitter speech his father used. But then his stern, as yet unweathered face soften and he added, "And you'll be welcome. If you conquer the world, littlest brother, be sure to save us a piece." A last smile and a wink and Relan had been on his way. One way or another, none of his family expected to see him again. One way or another, when someone left the high valley, they never seemed to come back. 

But if they could see him now! Mail glinting in the sunlight, hair blowing in the wind and the heels of these magnificent boots ringing off the cobbles. Announcing to all the world that he who walked in these boots was not a man to be trifled with. 

Yes, he would go back home and show them. All of them. His sullen family, the joyless villagers. He would come back like something out of the sagas that the strange wandering minstrels sang in a vain attempt to  cheer the flat, simple people of the land. But he would wait until he had something more than a new suit of clothes to show for his adventures. 

But the farther Relan walked through the city, the more troubled his mood became. Everywhere he looked, he saw the signs of the last night's carnage. Blood spilled on the cobblestones, bodies lying in the streets. Loved one's gathering corpses, families fleeing for the gates with possessions hastily piled in wagons. And fear on every face. 

His music of his strides against the stones took on a sour note and he wondered if he shouldn't have done more last night? But the memory of what he had done, the creature and the killing of it, send a shiver of fear up his spine. He hadn't had time to think. Hadn't had time to be afraid. But now that he had time, he was afraid, and worse. He was honest enough with himself to remember shaking afterwords. And the though of going out into the night again, to face more of those snarling, tusked creatures on wolves -- it turned his blood to water once again. 

He should have done more to help. A real hero would have fought all night. Would have fought until the enemy was driven from the city. But he had not. Why? 

Perhaps because it wasn't his city? At least not yet. He had only been in Robrecht a week. And it hand't been a pleasant week. Sleeping in a makeshift tent in muddy ditch underneath the shadow of the south wall had been rugged enough. But the people were worse. Unfriendly, mean, shrewd, hard-dealers one and all. None had the time to make a penniless farm boy feel welcome. For all the wonderful things he had heard about the cities, he couldn't understand why everyone was so excited about them. 

He had almost given up. Then he had had met Sabrellia. She had appeared to him in the muck and the mire of Robrecht's agricultural market. Relan was almost about to give up. He had come to the farmer's stalls to ask for work. He was a strong lad, after all and knew how to work hard. But as he stood there, hungry, exhausted, covered in filth, somehow he couldn't bring himself to speak the words. 

It would mean defeat. It would mean giving up and eventually going back to the farm in the tiny valley. It would mean that his brothers and sisters were right to laugh. And, worst of all, it would mean that the best he could hope to get from life would be that same, hard, beaten look that was the brutal, battered inheritance his parents seemed to have saved for him. 


"You seem troubled," she said. 

"What are you," taken aback by the vision of fully perfumed breasts, full, lovely and contoured under sacred robes. 

"I am a priestess, a loyal handmaiden of the Temple of Dar, but how could you not know that?"

"I, uh, am... uh..."

"You are a traveller!" she exclaimed, saving him from his awkward stammering. "A wanderer, a seeker of adventure!"

"Yes," he said, because he would have said yes to anything this perfumed, breathless woman said. She smiled and Relan felt himself go a little weak in the knees. There was a gap between her front teeth that her tongue seemed to darting into and away from. She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. 

"Dar commands us to serve all travelers and seekers," she said, stretching the word serve into an impossible number of syllables. "Tell me your name."

"Uh, Relan...?" he said, still bewildered.

"Well is it or isn't it?"

"What?"

She laughed brightly, in a way that was as far from mocking as the bright sunshine is from the rain. "Very well, Relan. I am Sabriella. I am pleased to meet you," she said with a curtsey. Then she slipped her hands around his arm and guided him from the marketplace. 

"My, you are very strong," she exclaimed, accidentally telling the truth. 

She guided him along Robrecht's streets until they were walking along the nicest part of the river. She talked with him gently and gave him the gift of listening well and laughing often at his awkward stories. In no time at all, he was completely comfortable with the radiant creature on his arm. 

"Oh, but you must be famished!" she said, and dragged him into a small pot shop. The owner's greeted her warmly and they were soon seated. To her great delight had three bowls of stew. Best of all, the owners wouldn't take payment. Which was good, because Relan was completely broke. 

They went back out in the street and walked for a time that felt to Relan like both and instant and an eternity. As the sun cast longer and longer shadows through the narrow streets and alleys, they heard the tolling of the temple bell. 

"But I must return," Sabrellia exclaimed, "I had not noticed the hours passing so quickly in you presence. I have only been granted parole for the day and the streets are not safe for such as I after dark."

"I will walk you to the temple and keep you safe," Relan said with all the sincerity there was in the world. 

"You must not! I cannot be seen with you. And you cannot be seen with me. I know to one so hardened to *adventure* the hardship of a dungeon and the Temple's Questioner means nothing, but I am a much frailer creature."

"But, I don't think,"

She placed a finger on his lips. "You are so strong, so handsome, so brave. The temple cares not for one so humble as I... but I know that if  I was in trouble... in danger I mean, that you would come for me. That you would save me. Just like a hero. My hero."

He nodded like the idiot he was. And was going to follow her anyway, but then she paralyzed him with a kiss. 

Of course, he had been kissed before. But the the simple, sullen, load-bearing creatures of his village hardly seemed the same species as the bright creature that pressed her painted lips to his now. Such a kiss! He felt his feet break into a sweat. He closed his eyes and saw colors that he never imagined existed. It was the kind of a kiss that would make a more experienced man ask some pretty hard questions about the supposed purity of the Virgin Priestesses of Dar. 

"Promise me you will meet me here tomorrow. Dar has inflamed me with love for you and you cannot deny the Goddess her divine purpose. Say it! Say you will meet me."

He swallowed hard and said, "I will."

And then she ran off around the corner, her sandaled feel slapping the cobblestones as Relan caught flashes of her milk white thighs beneath her flowing robe. 

When she was out of sight he rubbed his lips and smiled to himself. This was the start of it then. The grand adventure of his life that he left the village to find. 

Then the screaming started. 


# 15


Relan rounded the corner and slipped on the cobbles. With inhuman dexterity and a strength that came from long days of hard work on the farm, he caught himself on his palm and shoved the upper half of his body back on to balance.

As he ran, he saw two men in black running away with Sabriella, one holding her over his shoulder, the other glaring back at him and brandishing a wickedly curved knife. He was pretty sure they weren't priests , the infinitely kind and forgiving, first Goddess of Mercy, Dar.

On the street in front of him a third man lay on the cobbles.  He lifted a hand weakly and called after the kidnappers. "Please! Don't hurt her," he sobbed. Sobbed, thought Relan? What weak, unmanly, unheroic behavior was this? Had this man not heard the sagas? The full-throated minstrels singing of how heroes were to act when protecting beautiful ladies in distress through acts of physical valor?

Clearly, this one would be no help. Relan dashed passed him and turned the corner. In front of him was a long alley. Sabriella was nowhere to be seen. What sorcery was this? Relan ran faster, trusting that if the hero was pure of heart, he would come through okay in the end. 

In defense of this naiveté, Relan had spend many of his formative years listening to wandering minstrels trying to coax a meal out of flint-hearted farmers with song at the village longhouse. He knew them all by heart. And in not a single one of them had the hero ever stopped to check the doors he ran past. 

Relan ran on and on, running out of patience before he ran out of breath. He trotted to a halt and spun around, searching the blameless buildings of old Robrecht town as if they had personally wronged him. But, in the end, he was left with the ugly fact, they had gotten away with with love of his young life.

Cursing his luck and the perfidious sorcery with which Sabriella had snatched away from him, he returned to where he had lost her. The wretched man was still sobbing in the middle of the street. 

When he heard Relan's sandals scrape the street, the man looked up and said, "She is my sister. Oh cruel gods, it is all my fault." He dropped his head and his long, stringy hair fell across his face. Sobs shook his shoulders. 

Relan picked the man up and set him on his feet. He weighed almost nothing. "Who?" he asked. "Where?" 

"It's all my fault," he repeated. His large dark eyes seemed like haunted, sunken pits against his pale skin. "The dice. I lost too much money at dice. And they have come for her."

Relan said, "I can rescue her!"

"You? You have money?"

"No, I have no money, but I have courage."

"Courage?" he said, as he looked off into a hopeless middle distance. "They won't take courage. I owe them money. Do you have money? Can you get money. I meant to get money at dice. But..." and here the pitful sobbing took over once again. 

"I can rescue her! If you would tell me where they have taken her."

"No, they would kill her before they would let you have her. No, money is the only way. It is the only way to do anything in this world." The man with hopeless eyes said.

"Look at me. Look at me!" Relan commanded. "I will return your sister to you. This I vow. Now tell me where they have taken her."

"You?" said the man with a laugh bereft of hope, "You don't even have a sword."

The man's pitiful wails chased him through the streets as Relan went in search of a sword.


# 16


Of course, a sword was hard to find. Relan had tried to find one for two days before he worked up the nerve to go talk to Boltac. He had gone to the market, looking for work as a laborer. He had begged for change from rich passerbys. But nothing had worked. Sabriella's brother, a poor wretch named Stavo, who lived in a shack built against the outside of the Southron wall, wailed and cried every time he saw Relan. He told him his sad tale of woe, claiming that it was all his fault, but would not *do* anything about it. He lacked the courage, he said. He lacked the strength, he said. All he had was love for his sister and hatred for himself. 

He was worthless, except for the information that Relan had managed to extract from him. The men who had taken Sabriella worked for a man named Davidos, a thug who controlled the gambling in Robrecht. They had taken her to hold to the South, a pile of dark stone on the River Swift known as the Tower of Forgetting. There they would keep her for a week. Then the rapes would start. Then, a week after that, they were likely to cut fingers off. Relan did not ask how this creature Stavo, could describe such tortures in detail without breaking down into tears. 

Relan, of course, vowed that he would rescue his lady (with all faithfulness and heroism), but the how of it had been impossible until he had saved the Merchant Boltac. Now that he was armed, free and left to his own devices, the question became, what should he do? Robrecht needed to be avenged, and the threat of these Orc's and that evil flying wizard needed to be dealt with. Clearly, that was a selfless hero's first duty, wasn't it?

But on the other hand, he had unfinished business. His lady had been kidnapped and wanted rescuing. He could think of no saga, song or lay in which the hero had left his lady in peril to embark on a larger, more important quest. But, in a moment of unusually clear thinking, it seemed that the needs of the city should come before the needs of one heartbroken hero. Shouldn't they?

So it was, lost deep in the shallows of his limited philosophy, that Relan stumbled into a wheelbarrow with a corpse in it. He muttered half an apology before he recognized the bloated corpse in the bottom of the wheelbarrow. "Stavo! What has happened to you!" He heard a sharp intake of breath. A decidedly *feminine* intake of breath, and looked up to see a teary-eyed Sabriella on the other side of the barrow.  

"Sabriella, you have been rescued!"

"Why, I uh, yes, Relow! I, uh, have been..." she looked from side to side, unsure of what she should day in this situation. Relan's smile faded when he realized the two men pushing the wheelbarrow were none other than the men in black who had carried her away from him. 

"My lady," Relan said, "I thank the Gods that you have been returned to me unharmed, but I am confused by..."

"Oh, I just bet you are," one of the men in black quipped. 

"Silence, varlet or I will stave in your head," Relan bellowed, because it seemed like the kind of thing a hero should do in this situation. 

"Let's steal his boots!" said the man in black, because it was the kind of thing a thief should say in this situation. Relan answered by drawing his sword. 

"Oh ho, ho. Look who's a man at arms now!" exclaimed the man in black, as he drew his wickedly curved dagger. "You'd best grease that up, so it will hurt less when I take it away from you and stick it up your"

"Whack!" said the man in black's skull as the pommel of Relan's sword came down on it. 

"Please don't hurt me!" cried Stavro. "Haven't I been through enough!"

"You," shrieked Sabriella "What about me? How could you forsake your own sister, so recently rescued from ruffians of, uh, ill-intent!"

"Sister. You're not my sister! I swear, they forced me to do it. Please don't hurt me. Oh Shirley, you sure know how to pick 'em. I thought he was just a country bumpkin. Did you see how fast he moved?"

"Wait," said Relan, feeling that he had some part to play in all of this, "You know the men who kidnapped you?"

Stavro said, "Ah, well there you go. You can take the bumpkin out of the country, but you can't take the -- OH MY GODS, I take it back, please don't kill me." 

"I haven't killed anyone... here," said Relan, "What happened to him in the 'barrow?"

"Torn apart, by those things. Those Hork-Hork things. He died trying to protect me."

"Protect you!?!" cried Stavro. "We ran and you locked him out. I still remember him clawing at the door and screaming. Offering you his share... oh, right. But don't look at me that way Shirl, this grift is blown, this town is done for, let's just bury Harvuex here and get on down the road."

"Shirley? You're name is Shirley?"

"Well, I see you two have a lot to talk about. I'll just wheel poor Harv out the East gate, and when Thorvin wakes up you catch up with--"

"NO!" Relan and Sabreilla/Shirley shouted. 

"Those things are coming back, you know," Stavro said ruefully. "It's not safe."

"I go to root out the source of this evil," said Relan, not taking his wide eyes from Shirley. 

"Then you're an idiot, kid," said Stavro.

"No, he's brave," said Shirley, not taking her eyes off of him. 

"But I see it is not the only evil that plagues Robrecht Town. Treacherous woman. I... I... loved you."

"I know you did," said Shirley, not without kindness. "That's my gift. As for the rest," she shrugged, "Don't blame me. It's the world that's treacherous, I'm just a girl who's trying to keep up. Besides, a girl's gotta make a living, doesn't she. And I don't have a big strong man like you to protect me." As she said this, she edged closer to Relan, unafraid of the naked blade in his hand. She pushed the flat of it gently out of the way with her fingertips. 

"You know, we were trying take whatever money you could scrape together. I'm not proud of that." She ducked her head bashfully, then threw her hair back to reveal an expanse of perfect, pale throat that drew Relan downward into her dangerously plunging neckline. "But the feeling was real, you know." Then, like the sun breaking through the clouds after a storm, her pouty frown was replaced with a dazzling smile.

"Come with us!" she said. "Journey the land together. Make money, have adventures, *embraces* -- we could have it all. And with you I can finally ditch these losers."

"Right here," said Stavro, grunting as he struggled to get the unconscious Thorvin into the wheelbarrow. 

Relan almost believed it. Shirley almost got away with it. But whether the Gods were looking out for Relan, or whether Shirley's luck had run out didm't matter. The morning sunlight glinted off the thin-bladed dagger, Shirley was concealing along her wrist. It wasn't stout enough to chop off a limb, but it was enough to slip between chain mail rings, between the ribs of a strong man, just enough to tickle his heart and kill him. 

"What are you going to do with that?" Relan asked. He didn't give her time to explain. He didn't give her time to stab him. He hit the beautiful create in her beautiful face with fist. Then he looked down in horror at what he had done. A hero never, ever hit a lady. Relan ran away. 

When he heard the punch, Stavros had just finished getting Thorvin into the wheelbarrow. He turned and looked at Shirley, unconscious on the ground. "Aw come on!" he said, sick of this day already. 

As Relan ran north, he thought he might have just learned some kind of lesson. The confusion, the pain in his heart, the feeling of being totally inadequate to the moment -- yes, that's what it always felt like when he learned a lesson. But it  wouldn't be until years later that he would be sure.   

>Consider adding a scar or some piece of very specific description for this guy. 


# 17


For Relan, Adventure wasn't the glorious excitement he had hoped for. Mostly it was sore feet, with a slight tang of guilt. He had been following wolf tracks North for the better part of a day. The fine new boots that had looked so good in Boltac's store had started to gnaw at his feet as soon as he made it out of town.  

At first, he thought the trouble the boots had given him was from the running -- the running away in shame at what he had done to Sabriella, Shirley, whatever such a woman should be called. At the time, he had been certain that she was going to stab him him. But now, he had doubts. Maybe she had just been scared. Relan knew he was scared, deep down, in that part of him that wasn't fit to be a hero. But even if she had tried to kill him, a real hero would have found a way to deal with it without hitting here. 

And a real hero wouldn't be held up by sore feet.

As the day wore on, his criticisms grew sharper and his pace grew slower . Now he was spending more time resting than limping. Finally, he  gave up on the boots,pulled them off and tossed them in the heavy sack he carried/dragged behind him. Even with feet blistered raw, it hurt less to walk barefoot. 

And why not? He had gone barefoot in warm weather ever since he was a boy. The only boots he had even known were animal hides wrapped around his legs with leather strips to protect his legs from the deep mountain snow. And today was good weather. A fine day, except for the memory of the sack of Robrecht haunting him. It was bad enough to see the burned out husks and buildings, the common folk nursing their hurt and wrapping their dead in shrouds, but the memory of how that thing had felt dying on the other end of his sword was worse. 

He had wanted a sword so badly. Now that he had one, it hung heavy on his hip, pulling him around to the left. After the days walking, he could feel a pain in his left knee and his left hip. Every time his hand brushed the cold steel of the hilt he shuddered.

But he had saved a man's life! And the thing he had killed hadn't even been human. Then why did he still feel awful when he remembered how the Orc's last breath rattling out of it's body felt when transmitted through the hold of that sword. Didn't that make him a hero? Is this the way that heroes were supposed to feel? 

He had felt so good and fine, with the cobbles of Robrecht ringing under his bootheels and his sword, swinging at his hip. A hero, that was what he had felt. At least at the beginning of the day. Now, here he was, barefoot, tired and remorseful. Having made little progress other than knocking out a man who had tricked him and punching a woman. If he had been a more experience hero, Relan would have just been glad to be alive. 

But Relan kept going. If there was one thing he thought he knew about this business of heroism, it was that heroes didn't give up. Even when things got hard. No, heroes, pressed on. Saw it through to the bitter end. And sometimes, yes, died heroic deaths. But, what about the other adventurers? The ones weren't heroic enough to make it? The ones who took their boots off? No one wrote songs about them. 

Relan his head put one bare, calloused foot in front of the other. He didn't raise his head. Not even when he heard the rattle of a carriage and the heavy footfalls of draft horses on the road behind him. He just set his jaw and walked on, prepared to walk of the edge of the Earth if that's what it took. 

"Climb on, idiot," said a familiar voice. 

He turned to see the merchant, fat and happy, holding the reins of the Ducal Carriage. 

"What? How?"

"Not only am I smart enough not to pick a shitty pair of boots. I'm also smart enough not to walk when I can ride."

"Unlike you I am not running away."

"Sweetheart, you are clearly not running anywhere. At best, you're limping."

"I mean, I go to face this dread foe who has so wounded our fair city. I mean not to flee, but to revenge this wrong."

"That's a lotta big fancy words. You want to be the big hero? Save the girl, win the kingdom, all that?"

"Yes,"

"Well that's where I'm going."

"You," asked Relan, in danger of developing healthy skepticism in light of recent events. 

"I do have to warn you, you're probably not going to make it through this thing alive."

"Me? But I'm young and strong. You're old and fat. You're the one who's going to be killed first."

"En-henh. I'll give you odds on that. Out of the two of us, who looks more dangerous? Seriously, you got a crossbow, which one of us you gonna shoot first."

Relan let the question sink in. 

"You are young and strong and scary looking. They'll shoot you first. Me, I'm non-threatening."

Relan still didn't climb onto the carriage. "What changed your mind? Isn't this what you pay taxes for?"

The smile dropped off Boltac's face and he said, "The Duke ran away. Took his guards with him."

Relan's mouth dropped open. "Can he do that?"

"Age and treachery kid. That's his play and it's a good one. For him at least. So it's just us. Ain't nobody else. Which is good, because what we are going to do is *very* dangerous and *very* stupid."

"It's not stupid. You're going to rescue the lady, the love of your life!" said Relan. 

"En-henh, something like that. Anyway, I eeeeeeeh, like having her around and I'm going to get her back. Rescue is too strong of a word to, uh."

"Stout merchant, from down here it looks like you are blushing."

"Oh, uh, it's just the heat. The sunshine you see. I'm not used to it on account of I'm in my shop all the time," said Boltac, mopping at his face with his sleeve. And besides. If you're so smart, why are you coming along? What's in it for you?"

"Well," he said, "I'll get to make a name for myself. Be somebody. Maybe get a girl of my own."

"Y'know we're going to get killed. You're definitely going to get killed. And it's not even your girl."

Relan smiled. "Not if you brought any more of those healing potions. I mean that was amazing. I've never seen anything like that. I didn't even know--"

"Kid, I didn't bring any more potions. Not like that."

"Well, why not?"

"Because that was the only one I had. Magic, real magic is very expensive. And it's tricky. If your plan depends on magic, it's probably not gonna work."

"It was the most amazing, stupendous, unbelievable thing I have ever..."

"Yeah. It was magic. The downside is I'm probably growing an extra liver though. Or an extra lung in the middle of my stomach."

"It worked out."

"Yeah, but next time, ennnh," Boltac waggled his palm from side to side.  "There's always a downside with magic."

"So what did you bring?" Relan asked, looking at the bags on top of the coach. 

"A little of this, a little of that, and a shitload of coin."

"Why money?"

"Why money? WHY MONEY? Are you serious?"

"Yeah, there's not going to be anything to buy."

"Are you kidding there's gonna be all kind of things to buy. Not the least of which is the woman I want to get back."

"Wait, I thought this was a daring rescue?"

"No, it's just a rescue. If possible, I'd like to keep the *daring* to a minimum."

"But how am I supposed to make a name for myself?"

"Easy, you lie."

"Lie? A true hero would never do that."

"Okay, how many heroes do you know kid?"

"Well there's Uthgar, and Frowen and C'huhoyle."

"C'huhoyle my squeaky wagon wheels! Not heroes from sagas. Not dead guys you heard about in a song someplace. I mean, how many honest to gods heroes do you know. Have had a beer with?"

"Uh…"

"Take your time. Make sure you count them all," Boltac said as he let the soothing clip clop of the horses hooves and the tranquil beauty of the forest lull him into a kind of trance. 

"None," interrupted Relan. 

"Did you miss any? I mean is that an exact count? Because, as a merchant, I can tell you, it is important to be precise with figures."

"Okay, okay, you've made your point." Relan said, staring off into the trees. 

"Yeah, that's what I thought. There are two possible reasons for this, and pay attention, because they are closely linked. One, everybody who sets out to be a hero gets killed. And two, there's no such thing as heroes."

"That's not true. That't can't be true. Why there's got to be heroes. Who else looks out for the poor and the unfortunate?"

"The poor and the unfortunate either look out for themselves, or, well, then they're really poor and unfortunate."

"That's terrible. That's the most awful thing I've ever heard."

Boltac shrugged, "Hey, these are dark ages in which we live. I don't make the rules. I don't even like the rules."

"The rules suck. And I think you have it wrong."

"I wish I did," said Boltac, "but there's nothing either of us can do to change it."

They rode on in silence. For a long time. 

(( Kid, do you know why people fight wars?

To win?

"No, nobody wins in a war, except the guy selling swords and armor. No people fight wars to put themselves in a better negotiating position."

"Not for love, or honor or a righteous cause?"

"Not in my experience."

"But in the songs."

"Kid, they're songs. *Songs.* As in, not real."

"They're real to me."

"En-henh. And that's great, but the point here is fighting is stupid, negotiation is power."

"I don't think --"

"Yeah, I figured that one out already. Just trust me, if we can bribe our way through this thing, everybody will be a lot happier. And a lot more alive. Hey kid, you mind taking the reins for a while? I'm still a little woozy from that potion."

"Woozy? but it was magic!"

"Trust me, the hangover you get from magic is the worst kind of hangover there is."


# 18

Rattick was no hero. Like all true survivors, he found a way to profit from misfortune of others. At the first sign of trouble, he slunk into the alleys of Robrecht. While strange creatures marauded through the town and fire ravaged the buildings, he kept to the shadows, looting corpses where he could, burgling a store or two, until he reached the         South gate. When he found a horse in the Guard's stable he was gone into the night without a second thought. 

When he reached the forest, he abandoned the horse and stayed off the road. Rattick worked his way through the woods some 20 yards off to the side. When he grew tired, he climbed a tree, wrapped himself in his cloak and tried to nap. His sleep did not last long, for he was awakened by the raiding party returning from Robrecht. Horrible things on wolves, crying "Hork, Hork, Hork!" as they rode the unlit roads. Rattick wondered what treasure they had taken from the town. Probably just people for food. But, just in case, he followed their tracks, looking for dropped baubles by the light of a waning moon. 

The raid was was bad news for Robrecht, of course, but quite good news for Rattick. When word got out about the sack, adventurers would come from all parts of the Four Kingdoms. They would see glory and loot. And with such a school of fish to draw from, Rattick's grift was about to go big time. Maybe he needed a partner to handle the additional volume? 

With his careful traveling habits, it took Rattick three days to return to the entrance of the Wizard's lair. And when he got there, it wasn't there anymore. The once grassy hill and innocuous-looking wooden door was now a smoking hole in the earth. 

Wolf tracks led directly over the edge and into the maw of the pit. Hmm, so the Wizard had become fed up. Rattick imagined the scene in his mind. Often enough he had heard the howls of frustration echoing through lower dark of the dungeon. Of course, Rattick had amazed and frightened by the mighty magics he seen the man work. But that made Rattick smile. That one so wise in the ways of power to be so ignorant of patience. That was amusing. And something worth remembering. 

Did someone make it past the Troll and steal something of value from the Wizard. Yes, that would do it. And Rattick wouldn't be surprised. His efforts had been keeping the Troll so well fed, that half the time when he guided adventurers to the beast he had to wake him up. 

He could see it. The Wizard in his foul pit, ranting incoherently at the creatures he had made. Raging against insults and injuries both real and imagined. The Wizard throws up his hands, says a word of power and an entire hillside blows outward into the night. 

With a hue and cry, the Orc's of War are let slip. 

Yes, that's the way it would have happened. It was the kind of scene that one would place in a mighty saga to give the Hero time to rally an army and save the town. Except that there was no hero. And there was no army. Just a wound in the earth and an unsuspecting town that had been sacked.

All of this only served to make things better for Rattick. Powerful the Wizard might be, but he was ignorant of the ways of man. Now that he had sacked the town of Robrecht, even more heroes would come seeking to defeat him and steal his treasure.  

a more powerful wizard and now would lure more  and more powerful adventurers. And all of these would-be heroes would bring more valuables with them. Which was good for Rattick. When the next party came, he would spin his sad tale of love and life lost in the fall of Robrecht. 

He would summon tears to his false eyes and tell how he had come for vengeance, but realized to attempt the depths of the fiendish dungeon alone would be surest suicide. He would promise to serve his new friends faithfully. And when they fell prey to Rattick's trickery, he would profit. 

Rattick climbed into a tree, found a comfortable limb and dozed peacefully while he waited for the next flock of heroic lambs to come to the slaughter. His dreams of blood and fortune were soon interrupted by the sound of horses and, was that a wagon? Coming up the forest road.  

He peered down through the leaves and spied a coach fit for a king. Or a  party of adventurers so rich that Rattick would only have to run his bloody con one last time before he retired to the warmth and debauchery of the Southern Kingdoms. 

He clambered down from the tree to quickly, he nearly fell and broke his leg. He rushed to greet the adventurers in their splendid coach, noting that the strong-jawed blond lad who drove the carriage was wearing a very high grade of armor. A very good sign, thought Rattick, expensive armor, even on the servants.

"Hello, hail and welcome, proud adventurers. Be on your guard, for you have come to the lair of a Wizard most foul and dangerous. Humble as I am, I place at your service, my unworthy person, Rattick." He said, finishing with a low bow. 

Before he raised his head, he heard a familiar and irritating voice say, "Ah, Rattick, do I have a deal for you!"

He looked up sharply. "BOLTAC?!?"


# 19

"Rattick!" answered Boltac, not missing a beat, "Is it ever your lucky day!"

"Why?" asked Rattick with narrowing eyes. 

"Like I said, I have a wonderful deal for you. A deal no *honest* man could pass up."

Rattick made a face. "I think you are a long way from your store, shrewd merchant."

"And don't I know it. Relan, unload the bags, while I have a word with Rattick here."

"Who's he?" Rattick asked, nodding at the kid. 

"Him? Oh, he's the hero."

"If he's the hero, then what does that make you?"

"The cunning fat guy who outsmarts everybody in the end."

"I don't understand," said Rattick, for once telling the truth. 

"Rattick, I want to hire you. Now before you protest, here's 10 gold pieces. Now there's more where that came from. Plenty more. I seek an audience with the Wizard at the bottom of this smoking hole, and I want you to get me there."

"I… I…" Rattick got lost between trying to twist circumstances to his advantage and trying to figure out what in the hell circumstance was up to, "Have you lost your mind, fat merchant?"

"Because I'm here, yes. But I haven't lost all my cunning, you understand. Half you reward is with me, half when you get me back to town."

"Twenty gold pieces is not enough."

"I know that Rattick. I do. That was just to get your attention."

"I don't know if I…"

"Of course you can. What's that smell?"

"Troll."

"There's a Troll?" asked Relan, as he removed Boltac's bag from the inside of the carriage, "is this all you packed?"

"I travel light," Boltac said, taking it from him, "If there's a troll somewhere inside this hole then it's the same Troll he's been using to kill hapless adventurers, just like us. Isn't that right Rattick?"

"I would never do such a thing. I am here to avenge my beloved Robrecht. And I for one am shocked, SHOCKED --"

"Yadda, yadda, yadda. See kid, what he did there, nevermind kid, what he did was despicable. But the important thing is that we're not going to fall for it."

"No we're not," said the Relan, not knowing what he wasn't going to fall for, but scaring Rattick a little anyway. "Because I'm here to protect you."

"Protect me! Ha. Kid, you're here to carry the lantern." Boltac reached into his bag and handed Realn him the sacred, magic lantern of Lamptopolis. As soon as Relan touched it, it blazed forth with a brilliant light. 

"We're not going to be sneaking up on anybody with that thing."

"Eh, yeah," said Boltac, "You're right. You carry it."

"The magic lamp, do you trust him?" 

"I trust him to be totally untrustworthy. Which I can work with," said Boltac. But when Rattick took the lamp it went out. "Hmm, smart lamp. Okay, we'll use torches."

Rattick handed the darkened lamp back to Boltac and asked, "What do you want with me?" asked Rattick. 

"I want to make you rich. Name a figure Rattick? How many coins do you need to guide me to the Wizard at the bottom of this smoking hole in the Earth."

"Why do you want to see him so badly?"

"He has a friend of mine. And I'd like her back."

"Ho, ho ho. Is this love? Love from the man who is all business?"

"Yeah, I'm all business Rattick, so how much you want?"

"I can't get you past the Troll."

"What do you mean, Rattick? Sneaky little weasel like you?"

"No, no, I swear it. Ever since Dimsbury put the Troll there, even I haven't been able to sneak to the lower levels. Trolls have a very good sense of smell."

"Nah Rattick, you're just rotten to the core, so you stink to high heaven. But don't you worry about that. You get me to the Troll, and I'll take care of him."

"What? YOU? You can't be serious," Rattick collapsed in laughter.

Boltac frowned. "Y'know Rattick, if I'm gonna be your boss, you might want to show me a little respect."

"My boss? No offense, but I try not to work for people who will get me killed."

"Ah, so little faith Rattick. I tell you what." Boltac pulled a full coin purse from my belt. "This is for you. And three times this much when we get back to Robrecht with the girl."

"Even with my help, you don't stand a chance," said Rattick. 

"Don't forget about me," said Relan drawing his sword. The conversation came to a complete halt as both men stared at the Farm boy. In fact, they stared so long, the boy became uncomfortable and asked, "What."

"But that away before you hurt yourself," said Boltac. "Now where were we?"

"You were just about to get yourself killed," said Rattick. 

"Ah yes, exactly, ye of little faith. I tell you what Rattick. You lead me to the Troll, and if I can't defeat your Troll, you keep the gold. I mean after the Troll eats me and shits it out."

"Trolls shit gold?" asked Relan, very confused. 

"Gold is very hard to digest. Isn't that right Rattick?"

"I shall do as you ask. Then I will loot your corpse with great relish."

"There's my boy. C'mon Relan. Let's go meet the Troll."


# 20

As they descended into the darkness, Rattick thought about knifing them both then and there. They wouldn't be expecting it.  It would be a quick, certain profit. No chance of Boltac getting him killed. But no sooner had the thought crossed his mind than Boltac said, "I know what you're thinking Rattick. Why don't I knife these two right now and go through their pockets for loose change."

"That's not *exactly* what I'm thinking."

"Yeah, but close enough. And you want to know what I'm thinking about? Other than your inevitable and predictable betrayal." Rattick was silent. Boltac continued, "I'm thinking, if you're our guide, you should be going first. Kid, give this slippery bastard the torch."

"But I'm one of your key suppliers!" protested Rattick 

"He might steal your wondrous lantern," protested Relan. 

"That's okay," said Boltac, "if he stole it from me, he'd have nobody else to sell it back to. But if he makes you nervous, poke him with your sword a little bit. Don't kill him, just make him leak."

"Shh," said Rattick.

"Shh yourself, you crooked bastard," said Boltac.

"What's that noise," asked Relan? Everyone fell silent and realized that each step was taking them closer towards a truly horrible rumbling noise. 

The noise was intermittent and sounded like someone exhaling through a gigantic set of lungs filled with gravel. Then silence. Then that same, horrible, ingeopulmonary rumble. 

"That's the troll," said Rattick.

"Doing what?" asked Relan. 

Rattick waited until the sound had rumbled through the corridor again. It was far too loud to talk over. 

"Snoring," whispered Rattick into the sudden silence. "Which is a good thing for you, stout Merchant. What I suggest is that you keep to the shadows. Advance while it's snoring. Then you take your sword and plunge it right in his ear. It's really the only vulnerable place on the whole of a Troll."

"I don't have a sword," said Boltac.

"You can use mine," offered Relan. 

"That's nice of you kid. 'Cause after all it's my sword. But I'm not going to need it."

"What are you going to do?"

In the flickering light of the torch, Boltac took his heavy wool gloves from his belt and put them on. "I'm gonna do what I do best. I'm going to make a deal with him."

Relan searched his memories for any sagas or songs in which the hero had defeated the monster by making a deal. He came up empty. 

Rattick asked, "Stout Merchant, have you ever seen a troll?" 


# 21

The Troll was asleep next to a mount of phosphorescent lichen. Strictly speaking, the creature didn't need light to see, and it hated sunlight, but the presence of sleight illumination allowed the Troll to see the terror on his meals faces more clearly. There is an old troll proverb that says food better frightened, or scared is good eatin' or terror is the best sauce. It loses something in translation. But it should show you that, as a species, Trolls were prone to sadism. 

The troll woke up, when something kicked him in the foot. This was a decidedly strange sensation for the Troll. There really isn't anything in nature in the habit of kicking Trolls. In the dim light of the lichen, the Troll could see food, holding a small sack and looking at him. 

"Yoo hoo, Mister Troooooooll. Have I got a deal for you!" said the food. 

Wait, food was talking? This was confusing. Food never talked. Sometimes food screamed. Sometimes food tried to poke the Troll with sharp things. Most of the time food ran away. But it never stood it's ground and talked. And certainly never kicked. Since the Troll couldn't understand what any of the funny, squeaky little sounds coming out of food's mouth meant, it tried to understand *why* food wasn't doing any of the things that it usually did. 

Maybe it was poisoned? That thought disturbed the Troll. Since he often ate people without bothering to peel them, his stomach was a cause of constant trouble. And, for reasons he couldn't understand, he had been eating quite well lately. Food had been easier a lot easier to come by since he had come to this cave. He didn't even have to go out and terrorize the countryside. And how had he gotten to this cave? He couldn't quite remember that part. Something about a very loud and angry piece of food wearing black. But the memory was blurry and confused. 

Thinking made the Troll's head hurt. He decided that he had thought enough for one day. He drew himself up to his full height and let out a  good morning yawn (a Troll yawn is much like a roar) that rattled chips of rock off the ceiling. (a Troll yawn is very much like a roar.) The Troll expected that this would cause the food to flee, or curl up in a convenient, bite-sized ball of fear, but food was still there!

"There we go," said Boltac, "Come get a closer look at the merchandise." 

In the shadows, Relan said, "He's dead."

A Rattick-shaped shadow next to him said, "You are not as dumb as you look, kid,"

"Thank --" Relan began. But Rattick pressed a finger to his lips and silenced him. 

"Shhh. Don't ruin it. I'm going to enjoy this," said Rattick.

The Troll lowered his head and made two whuffing grunts. This expulsion of air freed his tusks from the ponderous folds of his cheeks and filled the enclosed space with the foul stench of troll breath. He stepped forward to begin his charge. 

"Here," said Boltac, "Try this." From within his sack of holding, Boltac produced a glittering silver mace. The head was encrusted with jewels that that glittered in the uncertain light of the dungeon. The whole thing was so large that it was more decorative club than mace proper. He held it out to the Troll and said, "Just try it, see how you like the heft."

The Troll, not being smart enough to fear a shrewd merchant's smile -- and generally not knowing what the hell was going on -- took the relatively tiny mace in it's absolutely gigantic hand. 

"There," said Boltac, and he released the mace. No sooner did let go of the bejeweled head of the mace than the Troll collapsed to the rough stone floor as if he had been smashed there by the hand of an angry God. 


# 22 Troll Pinned to Floor

Pinned to the floor, the Troll looked much less fierce now. His eyes were wide, and shifting fearfully as he whimpered a little. His foul claw remained tightly wrapped around the ornate mace. 

"What is that?" asked Rattick.

"That is a very cursed Mace of Encumbrance," said Boltac removing his gloves. 

"Magic," whispered Relan. 

"Yeah, kid, that's magic for you, there's always a catch."

"Like dealing with you," said Rattick said to Boltac with newfound respect. 

"Hey, I didn't force him to do anything. Here you go Mr. Troll. Here's a free mace. He took it."

"But the Troll didn't know…" said Relan.

"That's there's no such thing as a free mace? Everyone knows this. That's how they get you. And that's especially how they get you with magic."

"But what about Wizards? They use magic," countered Rattick. 

"They always manage to do themselves in in the end. Just 'cause you get away with something for a while doesn't make it safe."

Rattick said, "Marveled as I am by your cunning, good merchant, one question remains: How did you learn about the mace?"

"A guy brought it in a carrying case and refused to take it out. I thought maybe I could get the jewels off, but the enchantment was too powerful. My last apprentice was pinned to the floor of my shop for a week before we figured out how to get him out from under that thing."

"How did you manage it?" asked Rattick

"Ahhhh," said Boltac, raising a finger to the side of his nose. "That would be telling." His faded from his face as he added, "My advice to both of you? Stay outta the magic bag."

"No problem," said Relan. 

Problem, thought Rattick. He didn't know what could possibly be in Boltac's magic bag, but now he knew for certain that it was magic. And that the bag itself, might be worth more than he could imagine. And Rattick had quite an imagination.  

"C'mon, I don't want to be all day getting my lady friend back," said Boltac as he headed into the darkness. "How deep do you think this goes anyway?"

All the way to the bottom, though Rattick.

>Kid worried that the magic lantern comes with a catch. 


# 23 The Wizard Hated Administration

The Wizard hated Administration. He hated planning. He even hated arithmetic. Some days, he wondered if he had any talent for anything other than magic at all. 

He could create a monster and control it easily enough. But, little by little, inadvertently, and without realizing it until it was too late, Alston Dimsbury had created the worst kind of monster of all. An organization. 

He looked up from the ledgers and rubbed his eyes. Gah, supplies, inventories, requisitions. Some 2,000 orcs and wolves required feeding and clothing and organizing. It was all so tedious. But he needed an army. An army and an army of smarter orcs to run it. 

Intelligence is a dangerous thing to breed into a creature. You never know which way it would go. Alston had discovered this the hard way. Too much intelligence, too much initiative and your creations would be too hard to command. Or, at worst, they would turn rebellious. Too little intelligence and they would be useless. Sometimes dying because they forgot to breathe. 

In all his experiments with Orcs (his own name, he was quite proud of it), growing various strains and cultivars, he had many, many failures. He could only count one success in his quest to create the perfect mix between intelligence and servility. 

As a reward for his own success, Dimsbury had given the perfect Orc it's own name, and had made it overseer over all the other Orcs. He called it Samga and used him as his right-hand nearly-man-thing. Samga's duties were wide and varied, but right now, Samga was approached with a covered tray. 

"Ah, lunch," said the Dimsbury with a smile. A reprieve from paperwork at last. Samga smiled, or as close to it an Orc could manage and set the tray down.

When the Wizard lifted the cover, he found a bloody, unappetizing mess. On the plate before him it he could make out two slices of bread, some lettuce, two slices of tomato and lot of bloody meat. The Wizard replaced the cover gently and asked, "What is this?"

"It's an M.L.T.," grunted Samga with all the manners and polite inflection he could muster. "Man, Lettuce and Tomato samwich."

"And what is that?" asked Dimsbury pointing at one of the more disgusting looking bits.

"Well, it's man. Lettuce. and Tomato innit?" Seeing the foul look brewing on the Wizard's already foul-looking face, Samga changed directions, "o' course, the finest sliced leg of Man."

"Raw leg of man, I assume?"

"Oh, of course my master. Only the finest for you."

The Wizard replaced the cover on the vile lunch-like creation that sat before him. "And the leg of Man is, I am to understand, uncooked?"

"Oh of course, my -- oh, I see what you're getting at. It's just that Orc's don't, you know, cook meat, so the cooks don't, uh" Samga seemed genuinely hurt and flustered. "Really more of butchers, there, aren't they?"
 
"There, there Samga. You kind was not bred for cuisine, I understand. Simply take it away and bring me the female prisoner."

"You want us to cook her then?"

"No! No. Samga, I have other uses for her. Please bring her too me unharmed."

"Oh, all right," Samga said with obvious disappointment. He hunched over the tray  and started shuffling out of the room. 

"Here, Samga, what's wrong now?"

"Nothing my lord. It's just, she looks *delicious*."

"Yes, Samga, she certainly does."


# 23 Asarah in Dungeon


When the wizard had flown off with her, Asarah had managed to scream for all of twenty seconds before she passed out. When she awoke, she found herself unharmed on a cell of damp grey rock. There was no window and no furniture. 

Next to the pile of straw she was lying on there was a candle in a pile of wax that burned in defiance of the oppressive dark of the place. She got up and took the candle. The only way in and our of the room was a heavy oak door with a small window. 

Through the window she could see that the hallway seemed to be carved out of the same living rock as the cell. She listen carefully, but heard nothing. When she moved the candle away from the window, she thought she could see the merest him of a flicker of light from the right. 

"Hey!" she yelled. No response.

"You out there! I know you're out there. You can't have a jail without a jailer!" She heard the scraping of a chair against the stone floor. "Come here! I need to see you. I demand to see you."

The shuffling, snuffling noise moved down the hallway towards her, but there was no light? What manner man could see in the dark. She held the candle out

A face of grey-green, leathery skin, punctuated by tusks and beady black eyes eyes came at her from out of the darkness. It snarled and Asarah jumped backwards dropping her candle. The candle sputtered and went out before she could pick it up again. 

There, in the terrible darkness, she heard a sob and realized how afraid she truly was. She could hear the thing breathing on the other side of the door. She prayed she wouldn't hear the sound of the door opening. 

After an eternity, the thing grunted, and walked back down the hallway. Asarah did not cry out again. 

She felt her way back to the straw and curled up in a ball. This was awful. This was worse than anything she ever could have imagined. To be in a cell was one thing. But to be trapped in a cell because you were afraid to even escape…

After what felt like an eternity of terror in the darkness, she heard steps coming down the hallway. And this time light came with them. In spite of herself, her hopes rose. Perhaps this would be a person --  A human being -- rather than that awful thing she had just been subjected to. She looked to the faint glimmer of light that came through the doorway, but she did not rush to the window. 

Another of those strange, monstrous faces thrust itself into the window, but instead of grunting or snarling, this one spoke a soft, strangely accented English. 

"Pardon, my lady, but the master would like to see you now."

"The Master?" asked Asarah, reassured by the creatures manners and seemingly kindly demeanor. "Who is the master? For that matter, who are you? And what manner of hospitality is this?"

"I am Samga, my Lady. And the Master is, well, the Master, Maker of us all. And he has asked for you, the woman in his power." Ah yes, now it made sense to Asarah. The man who took her into the air had abducted her for a reason, the oldest reason of all. Men, thought Asarah, no matter how rich or powerful they might be, they were all the same. 

"And what are you Samga?" Asarah asked as she rose to her feet. 

"I am an Orc."

"An Orc. And what is that?"

"I know not. None of us do. We are made not born, in the bowels of the Earth, to serve the Master."

Gah, what an existence, though Asarah. And she simply *hated* the word Bowels. The door to the cell creaked open and Samga entered. As she saw him in the full light of the lantern, he was less terrifying than she thought. It helped that he wasn't riding a wolf or sacking the town in which she lived. "So what does your master want with me?" Asarah asked with a false pout. 

"It's not wise for me to ask, my Lady. We must go."

"Wait," said Asarah. ""I must look a fright. Your master will be unhappy if I do not have time to compose himself." 

"Master is usually unhappy," Samga said with a sad look that looked decidedly out of place on what was obviously a monster.  

Asarah knew what the flying man wanted with her she wasn't about to give it to him without a fight. But there were many ways to fight. And where a man had desire, a woman had an opportunity to torture. She took stock of her appearance as best she could without a mirror. Her hair, unruly at the best of times, was now an utterly, out-of-control mess. That was okay, some men preferred her that way. Unless she missed her mark, this Wizard was one of them. But her dress? ugh. It simply wouldn't do. She smiled an evil smile and started ripping. 

After her first few tears, her left sleeve and blouse was in tatters, revealing the hollow of her clavicle, most of her left breast and all of her left arm. Then he grabbed a hold of the skirt below the knees. A few sharp jerks and she was showing a lot more leg. Then she rolled her lips inward and bit down on them hard to bring a bright redness to them. 

There, she thought, that ought to put him in a twist. Not all men are wizards, but all wizards are men. Asarah, girl, we're going to see how much we can lead this one around.  


She turned and tried it out on the creature. When she didn't even get the hint of a reaction, she asked, "What manner of man are you?"

"Samga, is no man. Samga Orc! Now come. The master is waiting."

Hunh, she thought, Orcs must be gay. 


# 24 Boltac and Relan and Rattick 

They came to a fork in the tunnel."Which way do we go?" asked Boltac.

Relan put his hand on his sword hilt. "I say we go right, stout companions."

"Left," hissed Rattick in an immediate and automatic contradiction.

Boltac rolled his eyes.

"We should go right," Relan said, nodding to himself as if he was just figuring this out for the first time, "because the right and good is the... "

In the distance came the sound of strangely scraping footfalls and hissing grunts. The noises echoed wildly in the depths of the dungeon, so it was impossible to know where they came from. Left, right, behind. But one thing was certain, the sounds were growing closer. 

Relan grew wide-eyed and crouched down, hand on sword hilt. His gaze shifted quickly from passageway to passageway to passageway, but as spastic as he was, he could not look at all three avenues at once. Boltac shook his head and looked to Rattick.

"Orcs my merchant friend. Hungry for the fatty flesh of shop keepers no doubt."

"Enh-henh, let's keep moving." He said to Relan, "Quietly. And if possible, don't do anything too stupid." He slapped his kid's hand away from his sword. 

"To the right then, because we are for good," said Relan, nodding as if the matter was settled. 

"For good," snorted Rattick, "We are sneaking into a powerful wizard's dungeon to steal from him, what is good about that? You'll be no kind of thief at all if you try to be polite about it," Rattick said.

As the young boy's face grew red with anger, Boltac stepped between the two of them and asked, "Why do you want to go left?"

Rattick smiled, "I just like the left."

More guttural utterances echoed through the system of tunnels.
"We can't stay here," hissed Rattick, "too dangerous." Boltac made his decision by shoving through both of them and walking into the left tunnel.

Relan rushed after the merchant, "But you can't trust him."

"I don't," said Boltac, "This tunnel leads down and we needed to make a decision."

"He is not a man of honor," protested Relan.

"Kid, you don't know this yet, but Men of Honor aren't really all that useful."

"He means to lead us into a trap and steal the contents of your precious bag," he said.

"The bag is more precious than the contents, hey, wait a minute? Where is that weasely son-of-a-bitch?" Before they could even turn, they heard the sounds of a scuffle behind them. 

"Ah, Gah, ah-Hah!" they heard Rattick say from around the corner. On the wall, grotesque statues cast by torches revealed two shadows with strange pointed ears grabbing at the cowled shadow of Rattick. The froze at the spectacle before them. There were hisses and grunts, muffled curses and the sound of thudding blows. Then Rattick drew a sharp intake of breath and cried, "Save yourselves, I will hold them as long as I can!"

"We should help him," said Relan.

"En-henh. You think he would help you?" Boltac said, already turning to run. Relan gripped his sword. For a moment he was trapped there. Torn between the desire to do the right thing, and the bald fact that he knew Rattick to be an evil man. He watched the shadows tear at each other for a moment. Then he turn and ran. 

In an instant he caught up with the wheezing, slow-moving merchant. Straining under the weight of his brown sack, Boltac looked over at Relan and struggled to say, "If you feel raw about it kid, you can try and rescue him later." 

Relan ran ahead. Thinking that he was drawn to danger as the moth is drawn to the candle flame. 

Where the corridor made a right angle bend, Relan came to a stop. The stone work had become more finished in this part of the cave system. The rough edges had been broken off, and here and there, there was evidence of polishing and brickwork in places. Evidently, they were getting to somewhere.
From around the corner, Relan heard noise. 

He held up a hand so Boltac wouldn't run up behind him. But when he looked back he realized how silly that was. Boltac was limping down the corridor, panting heavily and dragging his sack behind him. When he saw that Relan was looking at him he nodded weakly and raised a hand. 

Relan drew his blade carefully, not making a sound. Then he peeked around the corner very carefully. His jaw dropped. And he moved backwards very slowly for fear that he might be seen. 

"Pssst," Relan said as he waved frantically to Boltac, "Hurry!" 

"Ennnnnn-heh," said Boltac as he put on all the hurry of which he was capable. By the time he reached where Relan was standing he was panting so heavily, Relan was afraid they would be heard. "Shhhhhh!"

"Kid. I. ain't. made… for running," Boltac said between gasps. 

"Look!" Relan demanded. Boltac raised his weary head and they both peered around the corner. It was Boltac's turn to drop his jaw. 

He had thought they were in a large corridor before, but when he saw the massive passageway through which scores of Orcs were walking, his sense of scale was quickly and forcibly recalibrated. Here, underground, was a massive corridor, wider than any street in Robrecht. It looked to have been hewn from the living rock itself. Large, interlocking arches graced the ceiling and descended in a series of gigantic columns that punctuated the center of the corridor. 

On the far side of the underground avenue, the comparatively small tunnel they were in continued. But between them and that tunnel was a space five wagons wide filled with Orcs. But not the snarling, ravening, bloodthirsty creatures that had descended on Robrecht. These Orcs looked positively, industrious?

"What are they doing," Boltac wondered aloud. 

On the far side of the passage a steady stream of Orcs descended in well-gruntled, torch-carrying twos or threes. And closest to them, a crack of a whip and the straining grunts announced the approach of a heavily ladened wagon. They slunk deeper into the passage and watched a team of four orcs, yoked like oxen, pulling a crude wagon up the slope. 

The wagon was filled with raw ore of some kind and by the light of the foul, pitch-smouldering torches on the front of the wagon, they could see an Orc with a whip sitting on the cargo. 

Crack! Went the whip. "Horrrrrk!" complained one of the haulers. And the wagon rolled on. 

As the back of the wagon disappeared up the passage, Relan said, "If only..."

"Forget it kid, we gotta find another way."

"But there's so many of them... did you know there would be so many?"

"What, you thought this was going to be easy? It told you we were probably going to killed. So quit your whining. Let's go back the way we came."


"We should go home," said Relan. 

"Enn-henh," said Boltac, "What happened to the brave adventurer?"

"I can't kill so many. I, I, I, I…"d

"C'mere for a minute."

"Go back? But what if we run into some of those things?"

"Orcs?"

"Yeah, Orcs."

"Well, there's a lot more of them out there then there are behind us."

Relan's swallowed and his face went pale. 

"C'mon, cheer up. You're gonna get another chance to be a hero. Most likely, more chances than you want." Boltac turned back and opened the shutter on the magic lantern the slightest bit. "Quietly now," he said. 

As they made their way back down the hallway, Boltac spotted a small side passage, that had not been visible when they came from the other direction. It was cut into the rock, leading away from the main tunnel, at a 45 degree angle. 

When he heard the shuffling, hissing noise of there pursuers close behind them, Boltac didn't have to think twice. He headed for the small passage. "C'mon, this way."

Relan didn't argue. 


# 25 Asarah Walks With Samga

Asarah followed Samga out of her dark cell. The passageway outside was just tall enough that Samga could walk with the tips of his pointy ears barely brushing the roof of it, but Asarah had to duck to follow. After a few minutes, the passageway opened up into a larger cavern. This larger cavern had several tunnels leading from it and Asarah began to see many, many Orc's walking to and fro. 

Some carried picks and shovels, the others crates and barrels, and one pair of the creatures carried a third that had obviously been wounded. They seemed, after you looked at them for a while, perfectly natural. How strange it should be that such creatures, should have a life below the ground that no one -- no human knew of. 


>Set the scene here for how the Orcs are going to grab Boltac and co. See the next scene. 

"What's going on?" Asarah asked?

Samga answered without looking back. The more grey than green of his back hunched a little as he shuffled his way through the tunnels, "Adventurers. Trespassers. Killed master's favorite troll. Master doesn't know about it, but when he finds out, he will insists that they be roasted on spits. I do not want to be roasted on a spit, so I have ordered the spits prepared for roasting early. 

"Roasting?" Asarah asked, trying not to wince. 

"Master doesn't like raw meat."

"He is a cannibal?"

"What means this cannibal?" asked Samga

"He eats people."

"No, master is a *good* master. He gives the people to us. 'Course, we like them raw, but the Master must have his fun.""

Asarah asked no more questions. Soon they came to a large arch in a formation of granite. In the arch was a huge door flanked by gigantic torches. Samga did not knock, but opened the door and waited for Asarah to walk through first. 


# 26 Wizard vs. Asarah

As she crossed the threshold, Samga said, "Master, I have brought the girl." 

In spite of her tattered condition, Asarah smiled. She was far from her girlish days. Her hands were worn from the endless toil of keeping an Inn, and there were lines on her face. More from laugher than from frowns, but they were not the kind of lines a girl had.  But still, the heat of her womanhood had not cooled. Perhaps that would be enough. 

The room she entered opened up into a high, arching ceiling. There were several braziers filled with burning coal that sent streams of greasy smoke rising in to the darkness at the top of the chamber. Rugs served to divide the large room into several areas but the center was cold, polished stone.

On the left there was a collection of shelves filled with scrolls, codexes, potions and ingredients under glass. On the far side of the room there was a raised dais, and on it a table. On the table there was a large glass jar, perhaps half the height of man. In the jar a flame danced, but it seemed to be just out of focus. It's light threw strange shadows and shapes on the ceiling of the room. As a Asarah stared at it it seemed just about to resolve into a normal flame, but it never quite did. She rubbed her eyes, but still it remained out of phase with the rest of the room. 

In the very center of the room was a hole plugged by a large, disc of wood held together with metal bands. It stayed in focus when she looked at it. 

> when the cover is removed, the smoke from the braziers will be drawn into the negative pressure of the hole. The "rather bottomless pit" sucks.

"Ah yes," said a voice to her right, "the serving girl!" Asarah turned her head and realized Wizard sat there behind a desk that was piled high with papers.

"Accounts?" laughed Asarah. The EVIL wizard is doing the books? 

This took Dimsbury somewhat aback. "They are EVIL books."

"Well, add this to your evil. You owe me for two mutton sandwiches and an Inn, which you burnt to the ground."

Dimsbury shut a large ledger. "Oh, yes, the MLT's. Sadly, I forgot them, but at least I remembered the most important thing. You."

"I know what you want," she said.

The Wizard rolled his eyes and pushed paper "and what is that?"

"Me," said Asarah, "You have taken me because you want a beautiful woman to bring comfort and pleasure to your life," she said with a roll of her hips. "And you think I will be attracted to you because you are a powerful man."

"Yes," said the Dimsbury, "I am a powerful man. And intelligent as well, some may even say charming."

Asarah snorted. 

"But you. Wait, you think that?" Dimsbury looked around for someone to share the joke with. But there was no one. "Ho, ho, ho, you cannot be serious."

"I am as serious as I am beautiful," Asarah said, almost choking on her own disgust for her words. But she had turned it over and over in her mind. Seducing this man was her only chance of getting out of this alive. 

"I mean, the thought of it! Really it is too much."

"Isn't it?" she said, flashing a great deal of leg through her torn dress and hating herself for it. 

"No, no, the very idea I mean. You are serving girl. Almost an entirely different species than I. The idea," he barked a laugh and then regained control of himself, "That I? I? A son of a noble house could take as a consort someone like you? It is laughable really. You are to me as," he indicated the parade of heads that adorned the wall behind his desk, "Well, as I said, a creation, or another species. We could no more mate than a snail and a, a, an Eagle!"

Confused and not a little offended, Asarah asked, "Well, if you don't want to *ravish* me then why have you brought me here?"

"You are to be my cook," said the Wizard.

Asarah stood with her mouth hanging open so long that the Wizard felt that he must clarify things for the simpler mind in the room. "Sandwiches, dear lady, I have brought you here to make me a sandwiches."

"Supper? You think I'm making you dinner. I am NOT!" said Asarah with the fury of a woman who thought she wanted to be scorned, but then decided -- when primal fury reared it's formidable head -- hell hath no fury. "I AM NOT A SERVANT!"

The Wizard looked at her for a moment. Then he got up from behind the desk and gave her a smile that was anything but reassuring. 

"I am glad you said that," said the Wizard.

"Because now you see that I am no servant or serf?"

"Well, now we have the question out in the open, at least."

"It's not a question. I am. I was mistress of my own Inn, before you burned it to the ground."

"Yes, I am sorry about that. I am fond of the occasional, overly flamboyant gesture you know. But, for just a moment, let us put the past behind us and start anew."

"Asarah looked at him skeptically but said, "Ooookay. Try me."

"You call me a wizard. And so I am," he indicated his surroundings. "As you can see I am a master of arcane and powerful forces the workings of which you cannot possibly hope to understand, but, you are a clever girl," Asarah winced. He said 'clever girl' in the tone of voice one might use to praise a prize horse or a well-trained dog. If this jackass was trying the smooth-talk it wasn't working. 

Dimsbury charged on heedless of the effect he was having. "So, I believe you can understand the importance of my work here. Work that, if you chose to join the team, you would be supporting in a vital, culinary role." 

"You see, I am not merely the cliche of some maladjusted character living in the bowels of the Earth, twisted and bent on revenge. Nor am a I a mere conjuror," and here he threw up a burst of flame into the center of the room, "though revenge and conjuring are well-within my capabilities.

"I am a creator, a researcher, a man who delves deeply into the very fabric that binds our realities together."

You're a guy who likes to talk about yourself, Asarah thought. 

"And father, to my awkward children. Isn't that right Samga?"

"Of course," Samga said. 

"Father? Of all of these, these."

"Orcs, I call them. I made them. All of them."

"What are they?"

"An alchemy of fungi, mineral and pure magic. Things made, not born. And surprisingly faithful servants. They are my greatest work, to date." He gestured to the wall above his desk. Asarah realized that there were a semicircle of orc's heads on the wall. It was a sequence, moving from crude and puny, to brutishly strong, to a head that looked very much like the creature's she had seen in the halls. But at the end, there was  an empty mounting plate. 

"What's the empty one for?"

Oh, that's for Samga. He is my finest work, almost like a son to me. And when he dies, his head will go there. Asarah looked at Samga. This revelation didn't seem to bother him in the slightest. Of course, Samga, was an Orc, a horrible thing, but Asarah felt a moment of pity for him. She turned back to Dimsbury and said, "Yeah, son, I can see the resemblance."

"Really? How strange, we look nothing alike. You are a curious creature. Now, that you have some sense of the importance of my work let us talk about the terms of your employ."

Asarah drew in breath and was just about to really give the Wizard a piece of her mind when there was a pounding at the door. 

"Come!" said Dimsbury. 


# 27 Wizard Kills the Orc Messenger

An orc charged into the room. This creature was squatter and more brutish than Samga, as if the sculptor's thumb had slipped and pressed the clay of him into an awkward wad.

"Master," it grunted. "Troll down."

"What?" said Dimsbury.

The Orc gave the Orcish version of a shrug and said, "Down. No get up."

"You mean dead?"

"No, down."

"Samga, would you please?" Dimsbury asked with an annoyed wave of his hand. Samga conversed with the Orc in their shared, brutal tongue. 

Dimsbury rolled his eyes and said to Asarah, "I am sorry about this interruption. There's always more administrative tasks wasting my time. Details, meddling adventurers. And Samga is the only one of them who has any intelligence..."

Samga had more than intelligence, he had cunning. He had been very careful not to deliver the bad news about the Troll to the master. He knew Dimsbury for the violent and tempestuous man he was. Especially when he was not pleased. And this news would not please him. 

All Orcs could talk after a fashion, but Samga was the only one who could talk that Master had not vented his fury upon. This was because Samga was very, very careful about what he said. 

"Master," began Samga, carefully, "This one says the Troll in the upper passages has been killed. He tells me that there are three adventurers loose in the lower levels."

"The TROLL! BLAST AND SLAPDASH!" Dimsbury roared. "Do you have any idea," he started to say to the Orc, then he stopped. "No, of course you don't. You have no idea. You haven't a thought in your head. You are merely a stomach with legs that walks around making bad choices. My finest creation to date, indeed."

Dimsbury turned to Asarah and lowered his voice. "Do you," he began again, "Have any idea how hard it is to even find a Troll? Weeks away from work. And then finding one, rendering the great big brute unconscious, having him transported here. Tremendous expense of time and effort and now someone has had the temerity to kill my Troll. I ask you, where am I going to get another Troll? At this hour? I don't have time for this! I don't have time for any of this!"

He pointed at the Orc and hooked his fingers so that his hand formed a ragged, palsied, fist-like object. The Orc writhed in pain as inside it's body it's bones were ground together by the unspeakable, sinister forces of the Wizard's evil magic.

When the Orc whimpered, Dimsbury smiled. Then the corners of his mouth dropped an he sucked air in between his teeth. As he did this, the Orc's skin tightened, causing the creatures eyes to bulge out. 

Asarah recoiled in terror from the Wizard's unspeakable cruelty. 

"Oh no my dear, you mustn't worry. They don't feel pain. Not really. Not any more than a machine or an animal does." There was a terrible juicy crunching noise. Asarah looked away and screamed. She her a wet slap as what was left of the Orc was hit the stone floor. She couldn't help herself, shaking, she turned to look at remnants of that poor creature. A low, weezing moan rose from the fleshy pile on the floor. 

"Dispose of this one, Samga. It is defective," said Dimsbury.

Samga nodded. With one arm, he reached down and removed the heavy wooden cover from the floor. Then, with a clawed foot, he kicked the crushed and still wheezing Orc in to the blackness of the pit. Then he dragged the cover back into place. 

Dimsbury said, "Creation is a messy business. One makes a great deal of mistakes you see. But thankfully, I have a very deep pit in which to bury my failures."

In the silence that filled the word failure, Asarah heard the the crushed corpse of the poor orc bouncing off the sides of the pit. Each time, more and more faintly. 

Dimsbury answered the unspoken question, "Bottomless." Samga replaced the cover. "Samga,"

"Yes, master."

"Send out patrols, catch them. Bring them to me."

"They might get a bit killed during the catching my Lord," cautioned Samga.

"Whatever is left, you bring it to me. And them we will have them roasted on spits in the main hall."

"The Orc's won't like that, my Lord. Spoils the flavor of the meat."

"So I am told Samga, but let that be a punishment for letting these dilettantes through in the first place."

Samga nodded and turned to go. "Wait," commanded Dimsbury and he turned his attention on the wide-eyed Asarah, who was staring at the pit in the center of the room.

"You. Yes," Dimsbury snapped his fingers, "Yoo-hoo."

Asarah looked at him like a frightened rabbit looks at a fox. 

"Have you changed your mind about entering my employ?"

Asarah school while she shook her head no. 

"Really? Even after what you have just seen," Dimsbury asked, more fascinated than upset.

Again, Asarah shook. Dimsbury's eyes darkened, and in her heart she knew that she was going to be crushed and tossed in the pit like the butcher's scraps. 

Dimsbury wave a hand in dismissal. "Oh, very well. Samga, chain her to that table over there. Perhaps boredom will change her mind. And give her some rags so she can clean up the blood on the floor. Excuse me, you stubborn woman, I must tend to my work."


> There's no such thing as bottomless pit. There's no such thing as free lunch. 


# 28 A maze of twisting passages, each alike

As soon as Boltac and Relan left the main passageway, the tunnel they were in sloped sharply up, then down. As they followed it, it twisted to the right, and then back to the left as if the thing that had made it was having trouble making up it's mind which way it really wanted to go. 

They came to a split in the tunnel and Boltac went to the left. "Ahh, the left," said Relan. 

"Shattup," said Boltac. Three steps in to the tunnel it bent sharply to the left, dropped three feet and split again. This time Boltac went to the right. 

"Are you happy now?" asked Boltac.

"Shh," said Relan. 

"Nevermind the melodrama, let's keep moving," said Boltac.

"But what if it is following us?"

"Then we shouldn't make it easy to catch us," said Boltac, striding off resolutely. But he quickly came to another branch in the passageway. This time a passage lead off to the right and several paces on, the main passage split again. 

Boltac kept walking and went to the left, just to piss Relan off. The tunnel rose steeply and twisted to the right, then dropped into another junction that looked suspiciously like that the one that they had just come from, but that wasn't possible. Was it? 

"Ennh," said Boltac.

"We're in a maze," said Relan. 

"No we're not, we're just fine, I know right where we are," said Boltac, not managing to convince himself or his young companion. The Merchant turned around and waddled back the way he came, but after three more turns, they found themselves back in the exact same room. Or one that looked exactly like it. 

"We're in a maze of twisty passages," said Relan.

"all alike," finished Boltac. He unslung the sack from his shoulder. 

"What are you doing?" said Relan. "We've got to keep moving."

"I'm checking something," said Boltac, digging around in his sack. "Besides, if all these passages are alike, then it doesn't matter where we are."

"Unless we're being stalked."

"Ah ha!" Boltac lifted the magic detecting wand from the bag. He waved it up and down in the air and held it in each of the four exits. The wand was unchanged in anyway.

"What?"

"This maze of little twisty passages is just a twisting little maze of passages. It's not magic"

"So, we're still lost."

"Yeah, we're lost, but we're not completely screwed. A solution exists," said Boltac holding up the finger.

"And that is?"

"Let's try always taking the right-most passage." Relan agreed to this readily enough and they set off. They walked for what seemed an eternity, but every junction they came to looked the same as the one they had come from. After an unknowable number of intersections, Boltac muttered, "Twisting maze of little passages," like the curse that it was. 

Relan sat down roughly and half said, half sobbed, "It's no use, we're lost."

"Easy kid," said Boltac, "It's an adventure. It never goes according to plan."

"PLAN!" exploded Relan. "WHAT PLAN?"

"Shhhh!" said Boltac. "We don't know where we are. But more importantly, we don't know where they are." He sat down next to the young man and said, "We'll rest here for a minute, get our spirits back."

He reached into his Bag of Holding and produced a skin of water. He drank from it and passed it to Relan. He swallowed greedily and wiped his chin off with his tunic. 

They sat in silence for a while. Then Boltac said, "Okay, kid, I get that I'm an idiot for doing this, but not for nothing, what are you doing here."

"I want to be a hero."

"Yeah, but why? I mean, before, I'd sooner die than listen to this story, but since we're probably going to die down here anyway," Boltac said with a smile.

"Why are you so cheery about it."

"You don't know nuttin, kid. This is an adventure. Of course, my favorite adventures are trading expeditions, but same thing. And the first rule of adventures, they're always miserable. You expect that. You expect the worst, and you have a much better time."

"You mean like my feet."

"Ah, that's nothing. We got enveloped in a dust storm coming out of Shatnapur. The winds blew for three days. We had no idea where we were going. Even the camels got lost. We were out of water for three days before we found the oasis. Hell, oasis, that's begin generous, it was a puddle of muddy water. Some of the camels wouldn't even drink from it. But I did. Felt fine for about an hour. Then I shit myself all the way to the next well. Eh, it was awful. My camel went from sand colored, to Boltac's bowels brown. Terrible."

"That's awful."

"That's adventure. Whyddya think I own a store?"

"Because you're old and fat and mean."

"I wasn't always old and fat, y'know. And someday, if you're very, very lucky, you'll be old and fat and you might not mind so much."

"Not me," said Relan, "I'm out to make a name for myself."





> Possibilities -- The Wizard killed Relan's father, but through consumption, like the pox or something like that. 

Boltac stretched his legs out in front of him, and lowered the shutter on the lantern so that it was almost all the way closed. A faint red glow filled the room. The Merchant stared into the gloom for a long time. Then he said, "Once, long before you were born, I carried a sword for a living. From far to the North. I first came to Robrecht from Mercia. To conquer the wilds and make a name for myself."

"But you don't look Mercian?"

"I'm not. Not exactly. You see my tribe is, well, we're scattered. And my family traded in the Mercian empire, but weren't exactly citizens, you see. So my dream was to… well it was your dream. I was going to go out in the world and prove myself to be strong and brave. Make a name for my self. Earn the token of citizenship. And then… and then I don't know what. 

"My father thought I was an idiot. And it too me years to realize he was right. The day I mustered out for the long march south, he said, 'Boltac, you're a trader, a merchant, it is in your blood.' 

"I told him I was going to be soldier and make him proud. His eyes filled with tears when he told me that killing would never make him proud. That I should be a merchant, keep a store, raise a family, know something of life before I died.  Add something to the ledger of the world, rather than take, take, take.

"I don't remember exactly, but I suppose I said something much like you did. Called him old and fat, probably a coward… ehhh. He was a lotta things my old man, but not a coward." Boltac shook his head and looked away for a long time. "Anyway, I never saw my father again. I came south. I think I imagined we would conquer the Southern Kingdoms single-handedly. There were four of us in the 7th Repreitors. We were thick as thieves and twice as greedy."

"Athos, he was a scout. And far south of here, just coming out of the mountains, he was scouting wide on the left flank of the army. And he came across an ancient city, crumbling on the edge of the jungle. Of course, there was no one there. But the promise of riches, boy, untold riches of an ancient civilization."

"We bribed the lieutenant, I was a supply sergeant, so I got us what we needed. And off we rode, bold as heroes."

"I have since discovered the identity of that lost city. That cursed place."  

"Did you find jewels."

"What we found was jewel encrusted death. I was the only one who made it out alive. I lifted a terrible sword from funeral beir, and as soon as I drew it, the sword attacked. The cursed thing welded itself to my hand and went after my companions. Within minutes they were all dead, and I was alive."

"It wasn't my fault, but I never forgave myself. Of course, I couldn't go back, so I deserted. Six months later I heard that army was destroyed. So I went to Robrecht, which wasn't under the Mercian empire and, well, the rest, as they say... "

It wasn't the whole truth, but it was all of the truth that Boltac was going to tell.  

"What happened to the sword?"

"I carried the awful thing with me in my travels. Thinking that the power and the skill of the sword would make me a mighty robber. It saved my life with some bandits, but in the end, the screams, the memories of the faces of the men I had killed, who I had loved as brothers -- who had become my family after I had abandoned my family -- I couldn't bear the touch of the thing.

"I threw it in the deepest part of the River Swift, and I had not drawn a sword all the way out of a sheath since that day. Well, since the Orc's. And, to tell you the truth, I don't care if I never draw one again."

"After you kill the Wizard you mean?"

"I don't want to kill anybody."

"But he is a terrible man."

"Fine, you kill him."

Relan thought on this a while and said, "With such a powerful sword, you could have been a King."

"Nah, kid. They don't let guys like me be King. Not even in fairy tales do guys like me be King."

"Why? Can't anybody be a King?"

"You gotta better shot of being King than I do. Farm Boy, turns out to be a prince, that's a great story. Merchant, nah, that…"

Boltac put a finger to his lips and looked up sharply. Relan heard it as well. Something moving through the passageway. Scraping footfalls and hissing. In the passageway they had come from they could see the flickering orange glow of torchlight. It grew brighter and brighter. Something was tracking him. 

Boltac whispered, "Draw your sword. This is where you get to be a hero."

"What?" whispered Relan. 

"Listen," said Boltac, "Here's what we're going to do."


# 29 Orc's POV

Hissglarg smelled human. And orders was very clear about humans. They were to be eaten. Not the crunchy face-parts, no, no. They was to be saved for identification, of course. But all the rest were free game. Like all Orc's, Hissglarg loved human meat. Of course, he had been bred to. 

It was a silly trait, one that evolution would never would have put up with. All Orc's really needed to survive was a constant diet of the deep minerals they had been grown from. But when Alston Dimsbury set out to do a job of evil wizarding, he didn't leave it half done. No matter what they needed to grow, Alston had decided that his Orcs would have a proper lust for the flesh of mankind, with not so much as a by your leave to the delicate processes that formed the natural world. 

This was all well and good (especially for Alston's vanity) but human meat played all hell on an Orc's digestion. In fact, nothing about an Orc's digestion was very good. A single orc, left to its own devices, could eat rock and soil all day, yet fail to extract enough nutrition to survive. So as an odd, created species, they dug and quarried and filtered and smelted and refined -- excavating vast underground complexes -- not for pretty jewels or shiny metals, but for dinner. 

The Orc held the barely sputtering torch close the ceiling and sniffed the air. Yes, this time to the left. He sucked the air and scuttled forward. Strictly speaking, Hissglarg didn't need light. Born and raised underground, the feeling of the rock under his claws and the scent of minerals, warren-mates and intruders were all he needed to navigate his way through the most tortuous of underground passages. He could never get lost. He would just follow his own smell back the way he had come.

Hissglarg had carried the torch because of something the-one-who-spoke-the-human-tongue had told him. He couldn't remember the exact words right now, especially with the intoxicating smell of meat so close, but it was something about human's liking light. And if they were lost in the dark that they would come right towards a source of light. It was close enough, what Samga had told him was, "Keep a light in their eyes," they are easier to catch that way." 

A light flared in the passageway before him. So brilliant, he thought it was that strangest of things, the sun. But what would the sun being doing underground? He covered his eyes and hissed in pain. Then he threw the sputtering torch at the source of light. It faded somewhat and in the encroaching darkness, he could see a fat sack of human meat, crawling along the ground after a lantern. Ah, dinner, thought Hissglarg.

The entree on the ground turned and looked behind Hissglarg. It's eyes went wide and it shouted something in the meat-tongue. Hissglarg did not understand it, but he looked behind him anyway. And there, to his surprise, was more meat. This one held a sword in it's shaking hand. It was younger and thinner than the one on the ground. In fact, it looked kind of stringy. But Hissglarg would eat the sword. Metal was tasty and good for you, too! The Orc grabbed the shaking metal blade in one of his taloned hands. Tears streamed down the boy's face, but he did not run.

There was a thud/clank, and blackness closed in from around the edges of Hissglarg's vision. The orc collapsed to the floor unconscious. 

Relan blinked the tears back from his eyes and saw Boltac standing over the collapsed Orc.

"Why didn't you stab him?" Boltac demanded.

Relan opened his eyes to see Boltac standing over an unconscious Orc with a heavy coin purse in his right hand. 

"What did you hit him with?" Relan asked, still shaking and trying to change the subject.

"Money. About 150 gold pieces. Mightier than the sword."

# 30 Rattick Betrays Him


After the chains were tightened around her ankle, Asarah crawled under the large table she was attached to and lay down. She did not cry. She did not give up. But, in spite of her best efforts, she fell asleep. The will may be strong, but when the body is weak, there is nothing you can do. 

She did struggle to stay awake. To observe her surroundings and her captor carefully. She searched for a weak link in the chain, a soft spot in the wood of the table and any flicker of distraction that she could find within the man. But when Samga had left, the Wizard Dimsbury has turned his back on her and devoted his full attention to the out-of-focus flame on the far side of the chamber. 

She had watched the back of his head very closely for about 15 minutes before the chanting started. It was low and guttural, and sounded like more than one voice. At first, she though there was more than one person chanting as the sound of it seemed to come from behind her. But when she whirled, there was only the rounded, stone wall of the spherical chamber, catching the echoes and playing tricks on here. 

Still, the effect of the strange, humming/singing noise coming from the the Wizard's throat, the stench of a smoldering brazier in the corner, and the hypnotic, flickering of the in focus/out-of-focus, flame/non-flame trapped under a ball of blown glass all conspired to put her to sleep. 

She awoke slowly, to the sound of voices. Whether she had slept for an hour or an age, she could not have said, but when she opened her eyes she saw the the strange, flame under glass was brighter now, and in better focus. The fingers of eerie light it cast throughout the round room were more substantial and cast deeper shadows. On the far side of the room, two of the shadows were talking. 

The figure of Dimsbury seemed to cower over a smaller cowled figure who seemed reluctant to leave the shadows. The two of them were speaking in whispers and she couldn't make out any of what they had said. Until the Wizard stood up straight, and exclaimed, "What? Come to rescue... the scullery maid? You must be joking."

The smaller figure shook his head and whispered more intently. When he paused in his explanation, the Wizard said, "Ho, ho, ho, no. Really? That is rich. Yes, yes. No wait, bring them here. Making an example of them will be a pleasant diversion."

"Yes," continued the Wizard, after another pause, "of course there will be a reward. I never presume someone like you does something out of the goodness of their heart."

The shadow turned and left the room. Try as she might, Asarah could not see the cloaked figure's face, but his walk was familiar. Strangely familiar. Her curiosity and her natural impudence overcame her more survival-minded instincts. 

"Who was that?"

"What, oh? I forgot you were there. I find your question tiresome, so you should sleep," said the Wizard and with a wave of his hand rendered Asarah unconscious. 


# 31 Rattick sneaks them in

"I am a failure as hero," said Relan. 

"You'll get no argument from me," said Boltac. "Now what do we do about this?" he said motioning to the unconscious orc lying on the ground. 

"Kill him?"

"Me or you, Mr. Hero?" 

Relan flinched a little at this. Boltac's face softened a little. He scratched the side of his round face. "Well, figure they already know we're here. And one more Orc, won't make much of a difference, more or less..."

"But, you must kill him, Boltac, you must!" said Relan with great sincerity. 

"En-henh. We'll if it's so important to you, why don't you take my sword off your hip and cut him down." Boltac looked down at the Orc sleeping on the floor, in somnolence it's terrible features somehow took on an innocence. Relan said nothing. "Yeah, that's what I thought. Tie him tight, we'll leave him."

"But how are we going to get out? It's a maze Boltac. A maze!" whined Relan.

Boltac slapped Relan across the face. "Now, you listen to me. I didn't ask you to come. In fact, told you not to come. I told you, you'd probably get killed, right?"

Relan nodded, rubbing the red mark on his face.

"And are you killed yet?"

"Then cheer up, 'cause things could be a whole lot worse. And likely will be before we are done. You wanted an adventure ya big dumb ox, and now you got one. So now what are you gonna do."

Relan didn't say anything, but knelt down and began binding the Orc with strips of leather that he cut from it's own jerkin. 

Boltac stuck his belly out and stretched a good long stretch. "Okay," he said to himself. Now that we're good and screwed, "how do we renegotiate this deal?"



"May I suggest stealth?" whispered Rattick's voice from the shadows. 

"You sneaky bastard," exclaimed Boltac, "You're alive!"

"Yes, I am rather less dead than mine enemies would like, this is the truth of it."

"How did you survive?" Relan asked.

"The God's love a thief," said Rattick. 

"You know, Rattick," said Boltac, looking directly into the shadow where the thought Rattick was, "as you're employer, I have to tell you, I have some serious questions to ask you. Not the least of which is, why didn't you tell me there were so many of these things?" he asked, gesturing at the Orc with his foot.

Rattick stepped out of the shadow behind Boltac and said, "To be honest, I did not think you would survive this long."

To Boltac's credit, he didn't jump... much. "En-henh, so now what?"

"For all the gold you have, I can return you and the boy to the surface where you will be safe."

"En-henh, I didn't come this far to return home empty-handed."

"You wish to go on?" Ratick asked, his thick eyebrows expressing surprise. 

"En-henh."

"You, perhaps," said Rattick, "but I don't think the youngling is still so keen."

"My courage is good, sir."

Rattick unwrapped his cape and cowl of midnight black. He stood toe-to-toe with Relan and looked up into his eyes. "I am no sir..." he looked him up and down in away that made his next word a curse, "Sir. And what does that make of your courage."

"Test me and you will find me ready, Sir." said Relan, trying to make an insult of his own. But the quaver in his voice was less than convincing. 

"Very well," said Rattick, giving Boltac a mocking bow, "I lead where my master commands."

"What'cha plan, Rattick?"

Rattick bent down and lifted the Orc's tunic. He plunged his dagger into the soft part of the Orc's thigh and held the creature's garment away from the spurt of greenish/black blood. In it's sleep, the Orc let out a low, sinking moan, as if it was deflating into death. The blood pulsed slower and slower until finally Rattick said, "There, now you can untie it. Bring me it's clothes."

Relan was wide-eyed and pale. He looked to Boltac. Boltac just observed everything with a look of professional disgust. As if the whole thing was going to cost him money no matter what he did. Relan bent to the task. 

"I know these passages far better than I have let on, Stout Merchant." Rattick said, as he wiped his dagger clean with a black rag. 

"No shit, Rattick? You've been keeping secrets from me?" Boltac asked with absolutely no air of surprise. 

"You've no idea, sweet merchant."
dwwwww
"En-henh. So, once again, whatcha plan?"

"By keeping to the shadows and whispering their with ancient tongue, I have found the woman. She is being kept by the wizard in a room at the very bottom of this dungeon."

"You found her, and you didn't bring her back with you?"

"By all the gods no," hissed Rattick, "She is clumsy and loud like you. And how I am I to know that she would not do something stupid, like this one," he gestured to Relan. "For money, I risk my skin, but for nothing do I risk my life."

"A wise policy, Rattick, and one I support. But can you get us to her."

"I can, but you will have to do what I say, when I say it," he pointed at Relan, "Especially you. If you do not, I will slit your throat myself."

"I'd like to see you try," said Relan.

"That's the point," Rattick said, his eyes floating glassily in the feeble light of the winding darkness, "you wouldn't see me try. You wouldn't see me at all."

"All right, all right, Mr. Death-Waits-in-the-Friggin-Darkness -- yes, you're very scary -- do you have a plan or not?"

"I do," said Rattick, "but you won't like it." Then he stripped the crude clothing from the Orc. When he was done, then he said, "Now we must skin him."

"Skin him!" said Relan.

"I told you you're weren't going to like it."


# 32 Rattick puts on the disguise

It hadn't taken that long, Relan thought, not really. It just felt like forever because Relan wanted to throw up. Relan had skinned things before, sure. Deer, squirrel, pig. But never a person. Sure. Orc's weren't people. They were monsters, but they had faces just like people. 

Boltac just shook his head and turned away while Rattick worked with his sharp knife and little tugs and jerks. "You really think *this* is going to work?" asked Boltac. "What's you're plan, scare them to death."

"Scare, no," said Rattick, "distract and confuse."

"With a pinch of disgust thrown in for good measure, no doubt," added Boltac.

"Ah, there it is." Rattick held up the skin and scalp of the dead Orc, complete with ears. He had fitted the creature's faceleather to his hand and held up the dismal beast's countenance, as if it was a puppet. "Looks like you," Rattick said to Relan. Then he darted his hand towards Relan's face and made him jump. The ragged cackle that followed was the first time Relan had heard the evil little man laugh. 

"I don't trust him," Relan said to Boltac.

"I don't trust him either. I *employ* him," said Boltac.

Rattick donned the Orc's, crude harness and then slipped the creatures face and ears over his own.

"Wait a minute? Where did Rattick go. He was here just a minute ago," said Boltac. "Seriously, that's a disguse?"

"This is a distraction."

"Where's our disguses?" asked Relan. 

"They're never going to see you."

"I'm not much on sneaking around like a coward," said Relan. 

"Oh, you won't be *sneaking*. You don't have the talent. They'll just be looking elsewhere."

"What?"

"C'mon kid, I think I know what he means. Rattick, get us out of this maze, before this Orc starts to rot."

Rattick bowed low, "Your humble employee, lives to be of service."


* * * 


They retraced their steps to the main tunnel. If anything, there were more Orcs than before. Now, instead of milling about aimlessly, one side of the tunnel were packed with Torchlit processions of Orcs hauling raw ore and rock up from the depths. On the far side of the passage, a series of empty wooden wagons being conducted back to dig sites far, far below. The Orcs did not use draft animals of any sort, rather one Orc with a whip sat an uncomfortable seat on the raw ore of the full mine carts while four of five of the other creatures pulled. 

"Horrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, horrrrrrrrr," the Orcs wheezed as their powerful legs pushed against the crudly paved surface of the tunnel. Slowly, slowly the wagons climbed from the depths. 

"Merchant," asked Rattick, "do you have any oil in that remarkable sack of yours?"

"En-henh, just a minute." Botlac rummaged through his bottomless sack. 

"There's so many of them," said Relan.

"So many shadows in the darkness, and what will three more be?"

"Is that from a saga? It sounds like it's from one of the sagas."

"No lad," said Rattick from the darkness, "it's from the other kind."

"Ah-hah," Boltac said in quiet triumph. "There you go." 

Rattick took the flagon and said to Relan, "Heroes aren't the only ones who perform deeds worth singing about youngling. Watch and see."

Rattick wrapped himself in the orc's skin, and donned his cloak of darkness, seeming to disappear before their very eyes. A shadow moving through shadows, he moved into the flow of traffic. He was a blackness with pointed ears, nothing more. For a moment, he was in step with the wagons going up, and then next, as natural as could be, he stepped into the lee of one of the great pillars that kept the ceiling from collapsing. 

If Relan hadn't known better, he would have thought this was just another Orc resting on the long climb to the surface. And if he hadn't known better he would have thought that this ordinary Orc was reliving himself on the pillar? 

"Uh, is he?"

"Clever, I'll give him that."

"In front of everybody?" asked Relan.

"Hidden in plain sight. Our friend is very, very sneaky. No wonder he's stayed alive so long."

"He's not my friend," said Relan.

As wagon neared the pillar, Orc-Rattick appeared to finish his business. Relan could imagine him shaking the empty flask and stuffing it in his waistband, but for all the world, he looked like just another Orc in the darkness.

There six Orc's pulling this wagon, yoked together in teams of two. As the pair closest to the Wagon drew abreast of the pillar, something happened to one of the Orcs. It barked out in pain and dropped in it's traces. The other Orc's immediately bellowed in rage, and the "driver," lashed out with the whip indiscriminately. The cavern was filled with such a roaring and commotion, Relan couldn't hear himself think. Even though Relan was looking for Rattick, he almost missed the sneak-thief's next move. 

A ripple of darker darkness came across the floor, underneath the reins of of the wagon. It was Rattick, rolling with noiseless precision. There was a small, silver flash in the murk and another Orc collapsed, clutching a wounded leg. The roars of protest turned to howls of fear as the wagon slipped backwards. The driver whipped and whipped, but it was a disaster in slow-motion, the oil making it impossible for the remaining Orc's to keep their footing. 

But the driver was on to Rattick. He saw a figure that was not quite Orc, crouching motionless on the floor. Relan tensed to flee. But as the driver cried, "HOARRRRRRRK!" and raised his whip, Rattick uncoiled in one fluid motion from the floor. He grabbed a torch from it's holder at the front of the wagon and shoved it in the driver's face. As the Orc screamed in agony, Rattick continued the motion, lofting the torch into river of oil he had planted in the hallway. As it burst into flame, Relan could see Rattick rolling towards them across the floor. 

As flames engulfed the wagon team, the overloaded wagon slid backwards, slammed into the wagon behind it and crushed a number of unfortunate Orcs who were trapped in it's path. 


crushing some of the Orcs on the wagon team behind it. 


After such a flash of heat and light Relan could see almost nothing in the darkness. He was only aware of the sounds of chaos and agony and the smell of burning flesh. "It's horrible," Relan said.

"Worth every penny though," said Boltac. 

"NOW!" Rattick hissed. He appeared between them as if from nowhere. He thrust both of them across the passage and into the mass of confused Orcs. Some were trying to flee the flames. Others were rushing to help their fallen comrades. They were everywhere, pressing on all sides of them. 

"Keep moving," Rattick hissed. 

Relan was nearly overpowered by their oppressive, musky scent. He wondered if this was what a lathered horse must smell like in hell. If any one of the frantic, harried Orcs in the passage had looked closer they would have recognized them for the humans, the interlopers that they were. But, in the confusion, they did not. The three were across the passage in a moment, and then safely away into the darkness. Relan felt like laughing. They had gotten away with it!

This was a very big thing for Relan. He was a good boy, the best of boys. Weaned on all the proper old tales of heroism, and

# 33 Botlac v Asarah 

Asarah was awakened by someone shaking her shoulder. In spite of herself, she shrieked, and scrambled back underneath the table. 

"It's okay. It's okay, it's me," said voice that was familiar, but shouldn't be there. Asarah opened her eyes and saw a face lit by an unearthly flickering blue light from below. She gasped. To be fair, it's nobody's best angle. The figure worked the lamp's shutter, throwing more light out into the room. 

"Boltac?"

"The one and only."

"What are you doing here?"

"What am *I* doing here? What are *you* doing here. You're the one who got us into this mess."

"Us, wait, what's going on here?"

"I'm here to--"

"No! No you are not. Are you telling me that I'm the damsel in distress? I am NOT a DAMN DAMSEL in DISTRESS!"

"Fine, fine," said Boltac, "Just keep your voice down. Now, how about you rescue me and get out of here."

"That's right! Because, I'm the heroine. I am the girl who rescues herself."

"And doesn't forget to take her best customer, Boltac, with her."

"Best customer, ha! Why, Boltac, when you're not trying to chisel me out of a drink you're trying to beat the check."

"En-henh, and I'm very sorry about that, but if you could hurry up and rescue me so we could get out of here..."

"Oh," said Asarah, sighing into the darkness, "I forgot. I'm chained to this table."

"Ah."

"Yeah."

"So, uh, if I..."

"Don't you even think about it," Asarah said. 

"Well, I think I have something in my sack here that could loosen those chains enough so that, y'know, you and I..."

"All by ourselves. You attempted this stupid rescue all by yourself, what were you thinking?"

"Hurry up!" Relan whispered from across the darkened room. 

"Wait, you brought someone else on this suicide mission!"

"Ennnnyeah, the kid I loaned the sword to?"

"You're endangering a child in this foolish rescue attempt!"

"All right, enough!" Boltac yelled, his voice echoing through the chamber. 

"I think somebody heard that," whispered Relan. 

Boltac slapped his forehead and shook his head. "Look, Asarah. You know this already, but I never told you. I love you."

"The only thing you love is money, Boltac," she said.

Boltac ignored this and plowed on. "And here's something else you know. You should shut up and let people help you."

"Hmmpfh."

"En-henh. That ain't an argument."

"Hm-mpfh!" She said. Making it into an argument by sheer force of inflection. 

"Okay, look. If it makes you feel better, I didn't come here to rescue you. I came here to ransom you. You know, to buy you back."

"BUY ME!" screamed Asarah, creating a racket far beyond any noise which this dungeon had ever had ever heard. "THAT'S EVEN WORSE!"

There was laughter from the darkness. Normally, in keeping with tradition, laughter in the dark would be sardonic. Or sinister. Or, at the very least, mocking. But no, this laughter was amused. "Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, that. Ho ho ho ho, that is... whoo! I can't take it anymore." There were two short claps in the darkness and then the room was flooded with a brilliant, blinding light. 

Dimsbury was visible as a darker area near the now blinding light trapped within the glass jar. As the intensity of the light faded, it became possible to see again. Dimsbury said, "Oh, that is rich. Without a doubt, that is the finest entertainment, I have seen since the comedies of the Imperial Mercian Opera. Or were they tragedies? I don't know. It's so hard to tell until the end. Do either of you sing?"

Boltac turned to face the Wizard. The powerful light that still suffused the chamber was too bright for anyone to notice, but the lamp he held now glowed a little brighter than before. 


Relan stumbled awkwardly into the room. Partially, it was because he had been blinded. But mostly because Rattick was pushing him from behind as he held a dagger to his throat. 

Relan knew who it was before he heard his rasping voice.

"Undo your sword belt." commanded Rattick.

"Rattick, how could you?" asked Relan. 

"Come now, boy, the question isn't how could I. It was how couldn't I?"

"For money, Rattick? For money you help the man who sacked Robrecht? Your home."

From across the room, Boltac said, "Aw c'mon kid, you didn't see that one coming? How could you not see he was working for the wizard all along?"

"I don't work for anybody but me!" said Rattick, "But I'll take anybody's money."

Relan protested, "But we have-- I mean Boltac has money. Plenty of it."

"Yes, but there is one important thing he doesn't have. A future. Dead guys don't pay their bills."

"The good guys always win Rattick. In the end, they always do," said Relan, as if it was a sacred pledge.

"Only in the the songs," said Rattick. A shiver danced Relan's spine. Because, for the first time, he believed the thief. Tears welled in his eyes. He might not be the hero he set out to be. It may be that Boltac was right and they weren't getting out of this alive, but he resolved right there that, no matter what, *he* would meet his end like a hero. 

Behind Rattick and his prisoner, ten Orcs pushed into the room and formed a cordon around the door. They opened to let Samga through. As Relan watched this, he realized, by comparison, how much more refined the Orc Samga, was. It was as if he was a slightly different animal all together. Recognizable as part of the same genus, but not the same species. The ones guarding the door were more animal. They snorted and scuffled their claws against the tile. They paid careful attention to Asarah. And one of them, staring with unblinking, hollow, black eyes, drooled a little while he watched her. 

Dimsbury waved a hand and his creatures were silenced. 

"So," he said to Boltac, "What brings such and unlikely and unprepared hero to the depths of my lair?"

"Hero?" said Boltac, trying not to let the fear show. "I ain't no hero. You want the other guy." He jerked a thumb at Relan, who was struggling not to cut his throat against the pressure of Rattick's blade by breathing too deeply.

"Be whatever you like. The question remains, why are you here? Why are you disturbing me?"

Boltac could see no percentage in lying. He jerked his other thumb at Asarah and said, "Her."

"Oh really, is it true love?" asked Dimsbury in mocking tone. He rubbed his hands together with great relish. When Asarah and Boltac both blushed, he laughed. "Oh my, it _is_ true love. And I thought it was rarer than unicorns. But wait, no it can't be true love, because you told me you had no interest in her. Or don't you remember. I admit, I was in disguise, but I would think a sophisticated man of commerce, such as yourself, would remember."

"I said she wasn't my wife, that doesn't give you license to steal her."

"I don't care for being stolen, Dimsbury" said Asarah 

"Yes, you are right. I have stolen her, fair and square, and she is mine. And you have come to fight for her. Fine. Take you pick of my creatures you see here before you. You may fight any one of them for her hand. Then, if you win, you may fight the rest of them. And then, if you defeat all of them, you may do battle with me."

"No," began Boltac.

"No? What do you mean no? You have come here as an *adventurer* -- as the Hero -- to rescue the damsel in distress. You must fight. That's how these things are done."

"I'm not here for a fight. You stole her, fine. She is your property, but I thought perhaps we could make a a deal."

"BUY ME!" protested Sarah, "is that your idea of chivalry? Buying the woman you love back from..."

"I never said anything about Love or Chivalry," Boltac snapped. "You know how many men have tried to defeat the great Dimsbury? You know how many have succeeded?"

"None," said Dimsbury with a great swelling of pride. "I'm entirely too powerful to be defeated by anything but a mythical chosen one, a thing which I reasonable certain only exists in within the protected confines of sagas. And if one does exist, I'm sure he's not a short, grubby, lame merchant from the backwater town of Robrecht."

"Yes, yes, mighty Dimsbury -- you are a wise, powerful and handsome man," flattered Boltac. "A man of the world who is quick to perceive his own advantage and capitalize on it. So I offer you a lucrative trade."

Dimsbury's eyes narrowed, "A trade you say, tell me more..."

Boltac reached into his bag of holding and withdrew a large coin purse that he showed to be overflowing with gold. "I offer 100 gold pieces for the girl."

"Girl?" Dimsbury snorted, "A handsome woman, certainly, but not a girl."

"The offer stands, a 100," he hefted the purse and reconsidered, "A hundred and two gold pieces, for Asarah."

"But I have such a love of her mutton sandwiches. Crisp and fatty and delicious." He shivered a little to emphasize the point. 

"I cannot compel one so powerful as you to do anything, but my offer presents you with a clear choice -- mutton sandwiches, or the gold."

"Oh that word. I cannot abide that word. Or. So harsh on the pallet, so cruel to the ear. I do not accept ors."

Boltac nodded his head deeply in recognition. I understand Great Wizard. I understand. But all life is trade-offs. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Surely you understand this. The money or the girl."

"No, I'll take the and."

"And," asked Boltac.

"And," asked Asarah

"Unh?" grunted one of the Orcs.

"The and," said Rattick with an approving nod. "That's what I'd take."

"Okay, so it's question of price," said Boltac.

"No, I don't think you understand," said Dimsbury with a little chuckle.

"Understand what? It's a negotiation. So, how much you want for her?"

"Boltac!" protested Asarah.

"The, uh, serving girl here," Boltac asked, giving her the signal to calm down with a downward wave of his hand behind his back. "I want my lady friend back. How much for your serving girl, my lady friend?"

"Well, *Merchant*, before we *bargain*, let me show you a few things, so that you might know what manner of man you are bargain with."

"En-henh," said Boltac. Even though the Orc's did not speak English, they could hear the contempt in his voice. Several of them snarled. Alston raised his hand.

"Samga, silence them or end them, I care not which."

"I hear and obey," said Samga. He whispered something in the crude, unfinished language of the Orcs. Whatever it was, the rabble at the far side of the room snapped to attention and stayed there.

"Ah, dear Samga, with a thousand such men as you, I would still have a horde of Orcs. But a better horde. At any rate, my dear Merchant, do you know what this is," Alston indicated the in-focus, out of focus flame that flickered on the dais next to him. 

"Eh," Boltac began, intent on speaking some kind of witticism designed to take the wind out of Dimsbury's pretentious sails. But the Wizard would have none of it. 

"SILENCE! I will have none of your mockery and crude calculation!" With a nimbleness that one would not expect from looking at him, the Wizard leapt up on the dais. He caressed the heavy glass vessel within which the flame danced. "This is beyond money. Beyond your crude buying and selling. This is the essence of the source, the headwaters of magic itself. See how it flickers imperfectly, blurred, to pure to be fully realized on this plane of existence."

Boltac rolled his eyes.

"No. NO!" Thundered the Wizard. This is not to be mocked. Not even slightly. This is power. POWER do you understand! With power you can get money. But no Merchant," he spat the title like a curse, "can ever buy power." 

"Have you ever put that to the test?" Boltac asked, with a scrappiness he was faking for the purposes of negotiation. Of course the Wizard was right, thought Boltac, but he'd be damned if he'd give this twisted noble the satisfaction of telling him that. 

To Boltac's surprise, the Wizard laughed. "Very good. Skepticism. The basis of all knowledge. Are you a seeker too, friend Boltac? Let me show you something." Alston stepped down from the dais and crossed to a small door on the far side of the room. 

"Come, merchant! I will show you what I think of money." The Wizard gestured to a spot on the wall and the blank stone changed into a doorway. "Themistres spell of ward and concealment. Do you know it? No matter." Dimsbury threw open the door. "Go ahead, have a good look."

Boltac walked forward. Through the door was what can only be described as a treasure room. There were chests and sacks overflowing with gold and jewels. Golden candelabras, plates, things decorated and encrusted by the jeweler's until it was a wonder they could still stand under their own weight. 

Boltac made a low whistle, "That is a lot of jingle-jangle you got there."

"So you see, your offer of gold, for the girl. Here, may I?" Dimsbury reached for the purse of a hundred and two coins. Boltac handed it to him. "Hmm, yes. Watch this." Dimsbury threw it at the feet of the Orcs. The purse opened and gold coins scattered across the floor. Instantly the Orcs broke rank and fought for the gold pieces. Only Samga remained standing, and even he seemed under a great strain. 

At first it seemed simple greed, but when an Orc got a hold of a few coins, he thrust them between his tusks and gobbled them up greedily. The pecuniary gluttony went on until there was but a few coins left, then the began to fight over one or two coins at the edge of the room. 

"Enough!" cried Dimsbury. Clapping his hands together and creating a sound less like a clap and more like thunder. "You see, my orcs are hungry for gold. Not greedy, you understand, but literally *hungry* for gold. They eat it. A flaw in the design, I'm afraid. They require heavy minerals and metals of all sorts in vast quantities. It's the only thing they crave more than human flesh. I am afraid I have created an armory that marches on the treasury. Upkeep is murderous, but then, so are they. And as you see, I have quite a lot of gold. And as they mine more for supper, your paltry hundred gold pieces is worth nothing to me. Merchant, you have nothing I want."

"Wait, wait," Boltac said, opening his sack, "I've got more. I've got a lot of of gold. I mean I don't even know how much it is. I don't even know how much thisNot as much as in your magic room there, but it's a lot. A fortune. And this sack, it's a magic sack. A sack of holding. Themistres. Take it, I mean please, you're welcome to it."

"Really," said Dimsbury, "One of old Themistres' sacks. I met him once you know?"

"Yeah, so, it's a very nice sack. This sack and all the gold in it. And, in exchange, you give me that vile-tempered woman. You don't want to own her anyway. The upkeep is murder."

"No one owns me," Asarah snarled.

"See what I mean?" asked Boltac, "Who needs that? I'd be doing you a favor."

"You know," Dimsbury said with a strange half-smile, "I must admit, you are a civilized man."

Boltac made a little bow, "Thank you."

"Do you have any idea how many people have tried to raid my dungeon, laboratory, whatever, trying to steal my property."

"I am not raiding you. I am a customer," he said with pride in the title.

"Yes, here for trade. Vile trade it is, but I admit, it is more civilized than treachery, deception and thieves."

"Deception has it's uses for the mighty," whispered Rattick from the shadows. This time he was in the other corner of a round room. How did he do that?

"Yes, civilized…" Dimsbury said, staring off into the smoky air of his spherical chamber. "I have spent so much time arguing for unreasonable people to take the civilized path."

"It's always the best way," Boltac said hopefully, "Reasonable people, getting along in a reasonable world. Able to do business together? Reasonably?" he asked hopefully. 

"It is surprising," said Dimsbury.

"Funny old world, isn't it," said Boltac. 

"Seize him!" commanded Dimsbury. Samga snapped his fingers and three Orc's leapt from the ranks and grabbed Boltac. Samga barked, "Take him to the cells," in the harsh tongue of the Orc's. 

"No!" cried Asarah.

"Wait, wait!" cried Boltac. 

"And bring the bag to me," said Dimsbury.

"Believe me, Mr. Wizard, you don't want to mess around in that bag," said Boltac as the Orc's dragged him away.

"STOP!" cried Dimsbury. "What did you say?"

"I said, for your own good, you should leave that bag alone."

"WHAT!"

"Okay, this is just ridiculous. What are you a moron? I said, stay outta the bag, or you'll regret it."

"DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM!"

"Johnny Hubris?" asked Boltac, "A guy I usedta know. Nevermind."

Dimsbury clapped his hands together and lightning bolts ricocheted around the stone chamber. Everything human in the room hid it's face against the terrible noise and rush of superheated air. "I command the forces of nature herself. I harness the elemental power that turns the world. I am to be afraid of your sack of goodies?"

"Only if ya not a jackass," Boltac said out of the side of his mouth. 

Dimsbury crooked his fingers into a claw. Boltac was ripped from the grip of the Orcs and lifted into the air.

"Holy shit!" Boltac said. 

"Offering me a trade," Dimsbury sneered. "I have no need of your trade. I will simply take the AND. I will take your gold AND I will take your sack AND I will take your woman AND I will take your life. Did I miss anything?" He waved his other hand and the wooden cover at the center of the chamber flew up the ceiling and shattered into fragments. Dimsbury directed the wiggling merchant over the bottomless pit.

"No. Don't crush him!" Asarah pleaded. 

"Oh I say," Dimsbury said with a smile, "That is a good idea. That way it will hurt more on the way down. Goodbye merchant."

Boltac vanished into the hole.


# 34 Aftermath

Asarah screamed until her lungs were out of air. When she paused to take a breath, she could still hear the far off echos of Boltac's body crashing into the side of the pit. She screamed again, but with very little air in her lungs it degenerated into a cycle of shallow, wailing sobs. 

"There, that's done," said Dimsbury, "Now I need a nap. Samga--"

As Dimsbury turned to address Samga, he presented his back to Relan. Strictly speaking, it wasn't the most heroic of opportunities, but Relan saw the opportunity and seized it. His legs drove him forward. He could almost feel the Wizard's neck in his hands. He could imagine what it would feel like to bash the man's skull against the ground. He made it one step, two, three. It was going to work! He raised his hands, then he felt the knife slide into his belly.

"No, no," said Rattick, still in the lunge position that had taken him out of the shadows, "we'll have no heroes her."

Asarah stopped sobbing and struggled to breath. 

Relan staggered forward a step more. Then Rattick slid knife sideways through the lad's guts and pulled it free. As Relan collapsed to the floor, Dimsbury turned and saw what had happened. 

"Hmm, yes, thank you Rattick, for taking care of that minor nuisance."

"I live to serve my lord."

"Yes, it would be nice to believe that, wouldn't it Rattick."

"Well, what ever humble reward you could see fit to bestow on my unworthy person."

"Oh, Rattick. Oh, Faithful Rattick," he said dripping with sarcasm, "Your job was to see that no adventurer's disturbed me."

"And for that, my cut was whatever loot they had on them," Rattick said, eying Boltac's magic sack greedily. 

"Yes, but you see, I have been well and truly distub-"

"Geh," said Relan, as the last of his life leaked out across the stone floor. 

"Oh good Lord man, just die already and get it over with." Dimsbury looked at Asarah, collapsed in a heap on the ground. "You'll clean this up! I swear to the Nether Gods you will. They're your rescuers. This is your mess."

"Rattick, I know not what to do with you."

"I just saved your life, Master."

"You saved my robe, Rattick. You think thing that he had a chance?"

"Eeergh," said Rattick.

Dimsbury bent over and addressed the dying boy directly, "You never had a chance! Do you understand? Not a chance."

Relan made a gurgling noise. 

"So, Rattick, I will allow you to take as much gold as you can gather and carry from Boltac's sack. Is that acceptable."

"Quite acceptable."

"Excellent. And I trust I will never see you again."

"Not in this, or any other lifetime," Rattick said with a courtly bow of his head. 

"Very well, Samga, take the sack to the UnderHall, gather the horde and dump the Merchant's gold for the feast."

"As you command, Master."

"But," Rattick interrupted, as gently as possible, "I take mine first, right?"

"Oh, no Rattick, where is the sport in that? No, you can scrabble and claw for your reward with the rest of my creatures. Conduct him to the UnderHall and give him the place of honor," Dimsbury said with a smile. Rattick was quickly surrounded by Orcs and led from the room. 

As he left, he had time to say, "You are too kind, Master."

Dimsbury dismissed them with an annoyed wave. 

"What shall I do about this one, Lord?" asked Samga, nodding at Relan.


"Samga, leave him to die slowly. Kill him not. But when he is done, you may feed him to whatever Orcs you deem worthy of reward. Or keep him for yourself Samga. You deserve it for keeping this rabble in line.""

"They will be so pleased Master," said Samga.

"I am a good and gentle master, am I not?" 

"The finest master," said Samga. 

"Now I am off to my chambers. I simply must rest. And the first creature to disturb me, will not remain a creature. Am I understood."

Samga nodded. Dimsbury left the room. Samga remained for a moment, considering the horrible scene before him. Underneath Asarah's choking sobs, could hear the labored, gurgling breathing of the dying lad. He twitched he head once, then hurried off to his duties. 




# 35 The Bottom of a Bottom-less Pit

Boltac awoke to more pain than a world could hold. It was a universe of pain, a cosmos of pain and he was at the center of it. In the darkness there was only pain. He tried to open his eyes and there was pain. He tried to close his half-opened eyes and there was pain. His body made the mistake of trying to cough. Then the darkness took him again. He didn't even have time to ask how it might be that the was still alive. 

An age, a time, or a moment later, he awoke again. There was a soft rustling in the darkness beside him and he felt the gentle touch of many creatures he could not see. It was not comforting. 

"Wha--" he tried to ask, but too many ribs were broken for him to speak. He wheezed in pain. The soft touches -- were they hands, or something else -- migrated to his side. Under their strange caresses, the pain eased. As he controlled his loud and labored breathing, he became aware of the low, whispered song all around him. It disappeared into the blackness with no echo, as if they were in the blackness of space or a room so vast as to be it's own walls. 

After a time, the pain in his side was soothed and his breathing came easier. Unexpectedly, his body was wracked with sobs. Tears streamed down his face in that place of dry darkness, and soft pads or hands blotted them away. "I should be dead," Boltac said at last.

"Someday, you will be," said the voice in the darkness. 

"Is this magic?"

"Magic? Just one flawed creature caring for another? There is a magic in that, yes."

There was silence for time. This made Boltac nervous, so he joked, "I guess this bottomless pit had a bottom after all."

"There is no such thing as a bottomless pit," said a soft voice in the darkness.

"No such thing as a free lunch either," said Boltac. "Who are you and why are you helping me?"

"We are the fallen ones, the discarded ones. The ones that were made, but not unmade."

"En-henh," Boltac said, trying to sit up and immediately regretting it.

"Be still, for your kind was once made. And, as broken as you are, are not beyond salvation, if you will allow it."

"Ho boy. What is going on here? Am I dead? Did I have to pay for own my funeral?"

"We have been shaped and know the way of shaping lives. We the forgotten ones. The made and discarded."

"Wait, wait, you are..."

"The Wizard's forgotten sons. The one's he made and thought to unmake, by discarding us in this place."

"So, uh, forgive me if this is a rude question, but, why aren't ya dead. For that matter, why aren't you dead?"

"When he made us, he did not weave a full spell. He did not allow for the possibility of death. So we must go on for eternity."

"Wait? You mean you can't die?"

"A horse can die, for it is alive. But we are like the carriage. We are not alive, but we function. We cannot die. Only fall apart for all eternity. Unless..."

The singing stopped. 

"Unless what? What's the catch. There's always a catch," said Boltac.

"We have done all we can for you."

"And thanks for that. I don't feel good, but I don't feel dead either."

"No life should be discarded."

"You don't get around much do you?" Boltac asked the voice. "Who are you. Not the plural you, not youse, but you in particular."

"I am the UnderKing, first among the broken."

"Oh, sorry about that, your honor, my liege, whatever. I didn't realize your kind had nobles."

"We did not. But in the darkness, nobility is called forth by need."

"En-henh? Come again?"

"The flame, the one the Wizard worships."

"You mean the 'Source of All Magic'?"

"The very one. He is powerful, powerful beyond all those who have come before him."

"But there's a catch," said Boltac, "There's always a catch. No such thing as free bottomless pit."

"If the link is severed, if the flame of magic is quenched, it will leave this dimension. And we will be released."

"So, ya telling me there's a way to snuff out magic? Like a candle?"

"But only a hero, a true hero, one chosen by fate and circumstance can overcome the Wizard and quench the torrent of magic. That is why you --"

"Wait a minute. Wait a minute! You're saying I'm the chosen one? Like *chosen*. Look buddy, no offense, but I'm just a guy trying to make a coin in this world, you understand?"

"In your heart, there is love."

"Love of coin, of course."

"There is more," whispered the shadow, "do not lie to me. In this place. There is no bargain you can make with the final darkness."

"There's always room to negotiate."

"Not at the very end."

"C'mon, all the stories and the sagas and the miracle turnarounds."

Silence. 

"Look, I'm not your guy. I'm sorry. The guy you wanted, your *hero*, is lying up there in a pool of his own blood and entrails. He was an idiot, but he was the better man. No thought for himself at all. What a Jackass. I wish I could be like him, but I'm not. I'm not your hero, so."

"What of the girl?" the UnderKing asked.

"What, Asarah?"

"Okay, look, I love her. I do. And I figured it out too late.  I blew it. So now I'm here, where ever the hell *here* is, I got the kid killed and there's nuttin' I can do about any of it. It sucks, but, that's business. I can't save her. I... can't..."

Wise in the ways of patience, the UnderKing said nothing.

"I can't even save myself. I thought I was a smart guy. I thought I had a clever plan, but now... none of my plans are clever. I'm just a fool. So, you know, kill me or whatever you're going to do."

"You are a broken thing," said the UnderKing.

"Yeah. Broken. No resale value whatsoever. So what do I do now?"

"When in darkness, follow the light," said the UnderKing as his voice retreated from Boltac.

"What? There's no light down here. It's the bottom of a bottomless pit!"



# 36 Follow the light.

Boltac sat in the dark for a long time before he saw it. There are many more  gradations of darkness than the human eye can see. In fact, it is correct to say that humans cannot see any kind of darkness, only light. But there is always a catch. As Boltac stared into that endless light and saw nothing, he realized there was a patch blackness that he couldn't see, but it was a patch of blackness that he couldn't see a little less than all the other blackness surrounding it. 

Very slowly, and with many groans, he got to his feet. His clothes, what were left of them, were in tatters. But when he felt his limbs and torso, he realized he was strangely whole. His ribs had stopped moving under his skin like a sack full of broken sticks. The strange pads and paws of the Broken Ones had somehow, set him to rights. For a moment, he considered that he might be a thing shaped as much as they were. 

"You are a broken thing." The UnderKing's words echoed in his ears. In the gigantic silence that surrounded him, the imagined voice was deafening. 

Boltac took a step towards the less dark darkness. It was unnerving to walk blindly. He slid his foot across the floor. Expecting a pit, or a knife in his back or any one of a thousand injuries or tortures or traps that his mind conjured up in the absence of anything to look at. 

Even moving at a snail's pace, Boltac broke out a cold sweat. But inch by inch, he moved forward. After a time he could not measure, he realized that the unseeable floor beneath his feet was sloping upward. But to where? How far had he fallen. There might have been no such thing as a bottomless pit, but there were surely deep, deep holes in the earth.

He came to a wall and felt his way along it in the dark. His hands clung to every fissure and rough place with greed and desperation, as if he could fall off into the darkness and be lost for ever. As he walked, he was overcome with the hopelessness of his position. He was miles underground, and could wander forever -- or at least until dehydration or starvation killed -- without ever finding his way out. 

"Follow the light?" Boltac called out. "Hey! I'm talking to you. I know there's something out there... in here... whatever..." he said, assured at first, but his voice trailing off at the end. He thought for a while about all the somethings that might be out there in the darkness. Maybe yelling was a bad idea. Maybe breathing was a bad idea. Maybe everything was a bad idea. 

Boltac lay his head against the wall and fought back tears. As the silent sobs wracked his body, his necklace of charms infinitesimal jingling noises against the stone. Did he have a ward against being trapped underground? He'd have to get one of those. When he got out of here, that would be the first thing he would do. Surely those barbarous, tanned, Southroners had a God of the UnderDark or some such. Who did the UnderKing worship, Boltac wondered? *Some*where, *some*body a charm against this kind of thing, and Boltac would find it. 

Wiping his tears away with what remained of his sleeve, Boltac pressed on. A few steps later, he found an opening in the wall, and in it, stairs. As he climbed, he realized that the steps were cut for a creature with a smaller stride than a human. It made climbing them even harder than climbing regular stairs. But even though his legs cramped and his lungs burned, he climbed. Not quickly. Not as a young man like Relan might, but slowly and without stopping. 



When the sound of Boltac's footsteps, rising from the UnderDark, had faded, Samga spoke to the UnderKing. "I told you he was not the one."

"It is not done yet," said the King. 

"He's no Chosen One. He cannot release us from the Master."

"Maybe it is not the one who is Chosen who can save us, Samga. Maybe it is the one who *chooses*."

"I have been away too long," said Samga, leaving his King. 

"I will await his return for a time."

"Of course," said Samga, "All you ever do is sit in the dark, and wait."

Samga followed his own scent-trail back to the secret fissure he would climb back to the Wizard's dungeon. He had thought he was out range of the UnderKing, but all of a sudden his voice was there beside him. 

"It's not all sitting and waiting, Samga. The darkness, is where an Orc can look inward, for here is nothing else to see."

"We were made hollow. We are empty inside."

"It is not done yet," said the UnderKing, knowing that that statement was always true. 


# 37 Boltac Turns back. 

Boltac stumbled through darkness for what felt like days. The stairs he had found ended in another darkened level. Again, he felt his way towards the lighter darkness. Stumbling into walls. Once almost falling into another pit. His nerves became numb to the constant strain, even has his hands cramped with the effort of reaching outward, ever outward. As far as his fingers could reach. Eventually the ache reached all the way to his shoulders. 

He was on the verge of giving up, when he felt the movement of air. A breath of freshness in the stale depths that had become familiar. But this air was light and sweet, like a cool drink of water on a hot summer day. His lungs drank it in greedily. And with his face and nose he followed the movement of that impossible breeze.

He rounded a corner, and then he saw it. Light. Not the brightness of a new day dawning. Not even the faint light of a candle guttering it's last spark in a pool of melted tallow. No, it was a lessening of the dark. But in comparison from the darkened places of the earth from which he had traveled it was beacon to lead the the way. He hurried and fell. Got up and fell again. Climbed stairs using his hands and feet. Then a passage to the left, then more stairs and then, there it was, a chink in the wall. A pure beam of light in this darkened place. 

He followed the beam to a crack in the wall. It was a hole in an ancient stone door, seemingly overgrown on the other side. After a struggle with the stone, he was able to pull it inward, with a great grinding of stone on counterbalanced stone. Grass and vine tumbled inward, and he pushed his way out, as if through sod, into the sunlight of a brilliant day. 

He was high on the side of a mountain, facing East, and the light was a sunrise. Near him, a spring burbled down the slope. Boltac drank greedily from the water. It was so clear and cold it caused his teeth to ache. When he splashed it upon his shaven pate, the shock of it sparked through him an emotion very much like hope. Realizing he was alive, free and in the light of a new day, Boltac laughed as he had not laughed for years. 

A short walk in the sunlight, a gentle stroll downhill, around the base of this mountain and he would be on the road back home. He had it on good authority that some people even enjoyed such walks in nature. 

And then what? Sell what was left in his store. Buy a boat and head South? A leisurely drift in the open air. Some fishing along the way. Large bonfires on the riverbank at night. 

And then what? A shop or trading stall in Yorn or in the swamp-ringed Squalipoor. Surely he would not stop in Shatnapur? That would be too close to Robrecht. Too close to memories. Too close to...

And then what? To build a business again. Make back something of the fortune he lost. He could do it. Wasn't he a lucky man? As he thought this he jangled the necklace of charms and wards. A lucky man. Luck bought with hard work and the money it had brought. 

And then what? His ease in old age, perhaps a place to put his feet up? He wasn't too old to dream of a family. A vineyard, something productive, not too far out of a city, but away from the bustle. And then, as an old man, the busy-i-ness of his life complete, he would put his feet on the hearth, sip the wine that was too good to sell and he would have time to think.

Relan falling to the stone floor. The look of confusion on his face, seeming to say, "But this can't happen, for I am the hero!" Asarah, lost to him. As lost to him as if she was dead. But her scream, her wails, crying for him. Would he not hear that echoing through the years for the rest of his life. 

He turned back to the door. "Who am I kidding?" he asked the bright new day. "I'm just gonna get myself killed. I ain't the chosen one. Who chose me? Who would chose me. I'm not the hero? I don't have broad shoulders or a strong chin?"

He turned his back on the door. "It was a bad deal from the beginning. But you got away with your skin. It's a sunk cost Boltac. Take the hit and walk away." He nodded to himself as if that that ended the argument. Good. Sensible. Mercantile. Just a bad deal. But when he went to walk away, his feet moved in the wrong direction. 

He fingered the necklace thick with charms around his neck and had a thought. It was a bad idea. It was all a bad idea. "You make your own luck," said Boltac. 

He took a whiff of fresh air. He said to the trees and the green grass and the water pure and dancing through rocks. The clouds parted and the sun was suddenly too brilliant. To all of it he made a silent, last goodbye and then headed back into the darkness. It was a bad deal all right. But Boltac had made the deal. And he wasn't going to break it. 

His life at risk? Sure, thought Boltac, leaving the door open behind him. But that was nothing. It wasn't just the sum of all his yesterdays he had put up to finance this ill-advised expedition. It was the promise of all his tomorrows. Unless he saw this thing through, there would be no ease by the fire. There would be no pleasure in shrewd trading and a crisp profits. There would be no, living with himself. 

Fine, thought Boltac. She loves me not. But I love her still. I cannot do other. The thought flickered, unbidden to his head, I guess that makes me some manner of hero. As he closed the door behind him, he answered his own foolishness with a skeptical, "En-henh."

It was harder to go back. Now he realized how stagnant the air was down here. Each step still had fear, but now they were robbed of hope and anticipation. He imagined he knew what waited for him at the bottom of the pit. So he followed the darkness, sinking in the blackness; at every turn heading towards the feeling of stale fear and dry death. 

When the gigantic, silent room opened up around him again, he stood listening for a time. He heard nothing, but took a chance anyway. "I know you're there," he said.

"You have returned," said the UnderKing "Why?"

"I need to find a way up."

"We told you, to find your way out, you must follow the light."

"Not *out*, back up. Into the mess. And with all the crap the Wizard has thrown down his hidey hole, you can't tell me there's not a torch down here somewhere."

"But this is the UnderDark. The Kingdom of things discarded that want to be forgotten," said the UnderKing.

"And a hell of pitch for tourism that is, but if you want to me to take on this crazy Wizard at the height of his power, I better get moving."

In the darkness a light appeared. It was a torch, and though it was well soaked in oil and burning well, the darkness did not give up easily. It pressed in on all sides. As the torch was lifted, Boltac saw that it was Samga that held it. And to his left, stood a simpler, cruder version of an Orc that wore a crown of bent and twisted metal. The UnderKing closed his eyes and still shielded them with a claw from the light. The UnderKing's features seemed like they were drawn in crayon, simple and plain. A moon face, mere holes for ears and a scribble for mouth. His simple symmetry was interrupted by a leg bent underneath him. It was twisted as if it had shattered in a fall and never properly reset. 

"Uh," began Boltac, but then he realized that the emptiness of the pit was anything but empty. At the very edges of the feeble light cast by the torch, were creatures keeping to the dark. Some walked, some crawled, some shambled. There were pieces of 

"Release. Release. Release." They all whispered in unison. Yet when they moved, they did not make a sound. 

Boltac tore his eyes away and looked at Samga. "Why are you helping me? Why do you betray your Master."

"Do you have a master?"

"No."

"Do you want one?"

"No."

"Neither do I. He is my King," he nodded towards the unfinished shell of the UnderKing who was averting his eyes from the light. Then he looked upward and added, "He is my captor."

"Okay, well, good enough for me. Now let's talk about how we are going to do this. We need to be patient. Take our time. Make no mistakes. We're only gonna get one shot at this guy."

Samga's expression did not change when he said, "He has bled the boy dry to lure the flame and soon will sacrifice the woman. By so doing, he will weld the flame to his power. 

"What?"

"It is blood magic. The force that binds mother to child, father to son and clan to clan. Very old and very powerful," said Samga.

"You forgot very crazy," said Boltac.

"He hungers for power and cares not how he gets it."

"En-henh. Okay, no offense to your hospitality there, King, but we need to get a move on. I'm late for an appointment to do something stupid."


Not opening his eyes, the UnderKing said "Blessings be upon you, One who has Chosen."

"En-henh. I see what you did there."

As Samga walked away, the broken one's skittered out of the range of light. Boltac followed. He didn't feel lucky, but at least he didn't feel broken. 


# 38 The Wizard, Killing Relan.

When the Wizard had returned to his sanctum, Asarah had crept as far under the table as her chain would allow. She sat wide-eyed and frozen like the rabbit who hope the fox does not see her. 

But Dimsbury had no attention for her. As soon as he entered the room he was drawn to the flame. He muttered to himself, "Brighter. More resolved. But how can this be?" Dimsbury looked around the chamber. He waved a hand at the wall sconces and the burst into flame, dispelling the uncertain, illumination of the magic flame and filling the room with an honest, sooty light. 

A glance at the floor revealed the cause. From Relan's body, a rivulet of blood stretched across the floor to the dias on which the flame sat. "Could it be?" Dimsbury asked. He removed the glass cover from the flame. Although there was no wind, the flames bent over the side of the dias. Dimsbury bent and dipped his fingers into blood. He held them above the flame, and as it dripped downward into the confluence of magic, it was transformed through a brilliant range of hues, and looked to be just a bit more substantial at the end of it.

He turned what was left of Relan and said, "You're not completely useless after all, what a surprise."


The Wizard wasted no time in having Relan strung up by his ankles over the flame. What little blood remained in the poor boy dripped into the cool, hypnotic light. The unflames licked greedily at the blood and became a little more focused and defined with each drop. 

Asarah wept at this horrible sight. She wept for the poor boy. He had tried to be a hero and he had failed. And now the stuff of his life was drained out... it was horrible. She wept for herself. That that this should be her state and condition. That she would meet her end here, under the Earth. And, it is true, she wept for Boltac. He was no hero. He was not equipped to even save himself. But in the end, he had come for her. 

She had forgotten her earlier words, but now they came back to her. "But that's how she *knows* that he truly loves him." He wasn't a prince. This wasn't a storybook or a saga, but he had come for her. It was not what she expected from romance, but it was true. Or had been. Now Boltac was dead, not to return. And she had been so cruel to him. 

Grief piled upon grief and sorrow upon sorrow, but she was so afraid, she dared not give voice to her pain. Silent tears streamed down her face as if the could flood the interior of the Earth. 

When Relan's blood had stopped flowing, Dimsbury swung him away from the flame and hacked the cords holding him up with a knife. The lad's body fell to the floor in an awful heap. ""

Without looking at Asarah, Dimsbury addressed her in a voice loud enough to make her jump. "My dear, I have good news and bad news!"

She did not answer. She did not even move. 

"The good news is that I no longer require you to be my cook."

All thought left Asarah and she started to scream. 

"Seize her," Dimsbury commanded. The screaming was perfect, thought Dimsbury. It was all according to form. The way such things were to be done But the Orcs did not move towards her at all. This wasn't right at all. It made her scream seem pointless and silly. 

Exasperated, Dimsbury exclaimed, "Her, there under the table. Grab her. Her. THAT ONE!" He made wild, uninterpretable thrashing gestures with his hands. "The screaming one!"

The Orcs finally got the idea and seized the woman. She passed out and stopped screaming. As Dimsbury watched the Orc's struggle to tie her feet to the ropes, he wondered aloud, "Where did Samga go? He was here just a minute ago."


# 39 In the Hall of Metallic Gluttony

> Make sure it's hundreds of Orcs.

Rattick had not pushed his luck. After killing the boy, he had left the Wizard's presence as quickly as possible. Sure, there was the question of payment owed, but Rattick knew as well as anyone that dead men collect no tolls or tithes. Best to stay alive, for there was no profit in death. The Orcs carried Boltac's sack high above their heads, fighting for possession of it as they raced to the Great Hall. Rattick followed in the shadows, waiting for his chance to grab something of value before he escaped from the madness of the Wizard's lair. Why were rich people always so dangerously out of touch with reality, Rattick wondered?

The Great Hall was ambitiously named and modestly furnished. A large cavern off the main passage, it was a darker analog of the refectory at a traditional boy's school. Large wooden tables with benches had once been lined up here. Now half of them were pushed into a jumble. A mock fireplace and mantle piece that had been carved into the living rock, was full to overflowing with bits of discarded bone and gristle. Here and there a wolf nosed through the scraps. Even to Rattick, this jumbled room looked like the end of a civilization. 

He climbed the wall, and shimmied down a thick iron chain to a long unused chandelier. There he took up his perch and watched and waited. 

The Orc's cleared a space in the center of the room, by pushing more of the benches and tables over. For a time, they fought over possession of the bag. Claws darting in here and there, trying to snatch the contents. Soon the room had filled to capacity with the brutish creatures. The noise of their disputations was deafening. The smell of so many of them, packed so close was debilitating. Rattick began to wonder if the chandelier had been a terrible idea. But he remained still and silent. There was nothing else to do. 

Soon the bag was upended and the content spilled all over the floor. For such a tiny, plain bag, it was shocking to see how much it contained. Among, the miscellany -- the occasional weapon, rations of food, bits of apparel --  sack after sack of coin, flew from the opening, landing on the floor with solid, seductive clink of loot. What would they do with gold, Rattick thought. He would wait until they were tired of fighting amongst themselves, then he would swoop down and collect as many of those sacks as he could...

Rattick's dreams of avarice were shattered as he watched Orcs claw the leather bags apart and cram the gold pieces in their mouths. They clawed and fought and ate until all of Boltac's gold -- of which there was a substantial fortune -- had disappeared into their monstrous gullets. Rattick sighted and felt an emotion that was very much like grief as he watched this scene. Ah well, the dungeon had been good while it lasted, he thought. He'd wait for the creatures to disband then he would sneak out like the thief he was. 

But the Orcs did not leave. Their squabbles died down, with occasional after skirmishes flaring up here an there, until most all of them, bloated on coin, fell asleep under, on and around the tables. Rattick cursed his luck, as he shifted his cramping legs. How much longer would he be stuck up here? He waited and waited. Finally, when the strange snores of the Orcs below wafted up to his ears, Rattick uncoiled himself from his perch and climbed back down.

He snuck through the sated and sedate creatures as quietly as he could. When one near the door snorted heavily and rolled over, Rattick swore he could hear the coin rattling in his belly. A plan suggested itself to Rattick. And always with Rattick, where there was a plan, there was almost always a sharp knife involved. He drew his cruel blade from it sheath against his thigh and considered how he could this quietly. With an ordinary person, he would just cram a hand over the mouth and slide the dagger down into the the neck. Severing an artery deep inside the torso to they bled to death internally in a matter of seconds. It was very clean and very professional. And Rattick prided himself on this knowledge of this secret assassin's skill. 

But with the Orc, this presented a number of problems. Not the least of which, how do you cover a mouth that has tusks. And he had seen how brutishly powerful these things were. He doubted that they would die quietly of their own accord. And how could he hope to hold this one down. He hunkered in a nearby shadow and considered his prey. As he did, he drew a whetstone from a pouch on his belt, spit on it, and began to sharpen the already razor-sharp knife out of habit. There was gold here, he just needed to figure out how to cut himself a piece. 

When he heard a noise from the hallway, he replaced the knife and sharpening stone and then hid his hands under his robe. As clawsteps drew closer, he closed his eyes so that the whites of them might not give him away when whoever it was first entered the room. This was an old and important trick of Rattick's. Hiding was a fine art, depending as much up psychology as camouflage and secrecy. The only time a person looked carefully at room was when they first entered it. After determining that no one was secreted there, they generally stopped looking. In fact, once they believed they knew who and what was in a room, it was very difficult for them to see anything new. It wasn't so much hiding in plain sight, as it was hiding in someone's self-enforced blind spot. 

He heard an orc enter the room. There was a shuffling and a scraping of claws here and there as he took in the scene, but no sharp intake of breath. No sudden movements Rattick remained unseen. Then the Orc spoke, but in the Human tongue. 

"It is safe, the are all asleep," said a voice both alien and strangely familiar to Rattick. He opened his eyes and saw Samga, the Wizard's clever pet Orc. And entering the room behind him... BOLTAC! In spite of himself and his skills of general and considerable sneaklitude, Rattick jumped at the sight of Boltac and struggled to stifle a curse. 

"Well, somebody had a party," said Boltac. "Did they eat everything?"

"Most like, just the metals."

"Good, 'cause there's a couple of things I would be nice to have," Boltac muttered as he began to search through the wreckage of the room. After a few moments, he held up a half-chewed, heavy wool, glove. "I suppose the other one is too much to ask for. See if you can find a wand, or the sack."

Samga held up a shredded mass of fabric that had once been a magic sack. "You mean this?"

"Ah crap," said Boltac. "Looks like we'll be doing this the hard way, unless..." Boltac looked around the room at the sleeping Orcs and their bloated bellies. "You know Samga, there was a lot of gold in that sack of mine. An awful lot. Did they eat all of it?"

"They kept eating until there was nothing left to eat," Samga said with a shug. 

"En-henh. Not sophisticated and restrained like you."

"As you say," Samga said, surveying his kin with sadness. "All of your gold is gone. Such a shame."

"It's not gone," said Boltac, "It's in your friends' stomachs, here. Important distinction."

Samga did not understand much of anything humans said. The gold was eaten. And that other word, he had never heard it before, "Please, what does this word 'friend' mean."

"Ya kidding me, right?" said Boltac.

Samga gave him a flat Orcish look that admitted of no humor. 

"Okay. You Samga, you're my *friend*. You are *helping* me, ergo, you are my friend," said Boltac.

"But I am just hurting the Master," said Samga.

"Yeah, it's a trade. You help me by getting me out. I help you by hurting the Master, and we both benefit. Trade, makes friends, Samga."

"But you can't be friends with such as I. I am beneath you."

"What? Don't be ridiculous. Beneath me? I mean, ya short, there's no way around that. But I know good people, and you Samga, you are good, people, uh, Orcle? Whatever, c'mon. I still got a lady to rescue."

Boltac noticed his wand, trapped underneath a sleeping Orc's leg. "Hey, uh, Samga, could you..." he said, pointing at the wand. Probably better if you wake this thing up."

Samga nodded and retrieved the magic detecting wand. It too had been gnawed on, but had fared better than the bag and gloves. Boltac used what remained of his tunic to wiped the saliva from it.

"Okay, this will do, now let's get outta here." They walked back to the door and Rattick could swear that Boltac looked right at him -- right into his eyes -- but saw him not. If the glance had lasted longer, Rattick might have been given away, but Boltac's eye was drawn to something on the other side of the door. 

"Hey," Boltac said, "The sacred lamp of Lamptopolis."

"Lamptopolis?" asked Samga.

"Eh, nevermind. It's a long story. It doesn't really work that well for me, but, as I always say, you can never have too much light or too much water." Boltac reached down and grabbed the lamp by it's handle. As he held it up, it blazed forth with a clear brilliant light that filled the room as if the sun had been harnessed and dragged into the bowels of the earth. 

Samga hissed and averted his eyes. Rattick, closed his eyes to protect his night vision, but otherwise. stayed absolutely motionless, realizing that he was completely exposed. 

Boltac said, "Holy crap," and dropped the lamp. It gradually fade away. Leaving a confused Boltac standing over it, rubbing his eyes to try and get rid of the spots the brilliance had left. As the Orcs began to wake up, Boltac said, "I don't understand. I mean, I'm not a hero."

"We must go," said Samga.

Boltac grabbed the remnants of Themistre's Bag of Holding and wrapped them around the lamp handle. He picked it up and was relieved that it did not light. As he held it, he moved the burlap so that it covered the motto carved into the metal. "Burns with the flame of a true heart," he muttered, "En-henh."

One of the slow-to-rise Orcs saw them go. He cried, "Hork!" but it was a half-hearted protest at best. The gold hung heavy in his belly and he struggled to rise. 

Rattick slipped out of the shadows. How had Boltac survived? And where was he headed now? Rattick sensed chaos. And where chaos rode, there were always plenty spoils for the taking. He followed the merchant and his unlikely guide from a distance. 


# 40 Confronting the Wizard

> Do we need to sharpen the conflict between Samga and Dimsbury -- does Samga deliver the coup de grace of throwing the wizard into the firery rippling gap of spacetime

"Samga. There you are," said Dimsbury. "Thank the Gods you have returned. Pass me that knife over there so I may open this woman's neck." Dimsbury turned back to Asarah who now hung by her legs, upside down above the flame that danced half-in-focus, half-out-of-focus above it's stone dias. Asarah attempted to scream, but it was muffled by a gag which Dimsbury now tightened. "I must say, I enjoy your company much more now that you are quiet. It will almost be sad to see you go. Samga, the knife!"

From over his shoulder, Dimsbury heard Samga say, "No."

"No? What do you mean there is no,'No.'--"

"The Wizard turned to see his prized creature standing next to a smiling Boltac. "Samga, what do you have there. And where ever did you find it?"

"I'm back like a bad penny," said Boltac. 

"Before we get to the question of how," Dimsbury said, in a way that suggested that this was all so tiresome, "I will ask why?"

"I'm here to do you in."

Dimsbury gestured, vaguely, a Relan's body, discarded along the wall. "Yes, that was his idea as well. What makes you think you will fare any better?"

"I am not an idiot."

"Idiots never think they are."

> Does Asarah need to scream or protest or struggle somehow, to keep herself in the scene? Does she headbutt Dimsbury at a critical juncture so she is not so passive?

"Eh-henh, you want me to say touché, or you just want to get down to it."

"Very well," said Dimsbury, and picked a medium-sized silver whistle from his desk. "I shall let me staff handle the light work." He placed his lips to the whistle and blew. No sound came from the whistle, but Samga writhed in pain.

From the hall there was a groaning commotion. And soon, metal-bloated Orc's streamed into the room. They snorted and growled and grunted and bitched in their brutish language about being awakened from their post-gluttony slumber. And if such a thing was possible, they seemed even more frightening and contentious than Orcs usually did. 

Dimsbury drew himself up to his full height. He raised his arms and electricity crackled along his fingertips and along the surface of his robes. In full voice, he began his mighty, doom-filled pronouncement. "Tear him --"

"Hang on," said Boltac interrupting. "Hang on. Sorry to ruin your speech there. But I've got one of those too." Boltac reached for his charm necklace. For the first time in a long time, he felt very, very lucky. He placed the tiny, silver whistle to his lips and blew. 

Nothing happened.

"I'm sorry, is that it?" said Dimsbury, his voice dripping with contempt. 

"Eh, hang on," Boltac put the whistle to his lips and blew as hard as he could. Blew until he was red in the face. Blew until he was sputtering and out of air. When he was done he said, "huuuuuuuuh," as he gasped for air. 

The Orcs looked a Boltac. Samga looked at Boltac. Hanging upside down, Asarah closed her eyes. 

"Yes," said Dimsbury, "if you are quite through?" Boltac looked down and away. "TEAR HIM LIMB FROM LIMB!"

There was no where to run. There was nothing to do. As the first Orc advanced, Boltac turned to Samga and said, "Sorry, I thought that would work."

Snarling the front line of Orcs reached out for Boltac. Their claws and tusks searched through savage arcs for the soft, fat flesh of the Merchant. But before he was torn open, the biggest Orc of all let out a long, almost mournful howl of pain. The other Orcs stopped to watch as the largest of them grasped his stomach and collapsed to the floor. Then another fell, and then another, until all of them were lying on the floor, writhing in pain. 

"What is this foolishness?" demanded Dimsbury.

Boltac kept blowing the whistle as hard as he could. As the Orcs writhed in agony on the floor. The largest of them made the connection. He lifted his taloned hand off the ground then plunged it deeply into his own stomach. The whistle dropped from Boltac's lips has his face contorted in disgust. Coins exploded outward from the unfortunate creatures stomach, clicking and clinking as they ripped tiny slices of flesh from the now dying creature. 

A bolt of lightning exploded in the room and lept to the Orc

Boltac held up his gloved hand and it slurped up Dimsbury's lightning bolt like a spaghetti noodle. "Hey! That worked!" Boltac said, laughing giddily. 

Dimsbury furrowed his brow and said, "Very well. The fat man wants to play."

The next bolt of lightning was so powerful, Boltac thought that his eyeballs had been seared from his head. But as his eyes adjusted, he realized it had just been so bright that he had gone momentarily blind. But still, the glove on his left hand remained intact. As Dimsbury extended his arm again, Boltac closed his eyes. He felt an impact on his arm. And again, and again. The palm of the glove grew hot and fought off the urge to shake his hand. On this belt the magic detecting wand vibrated wildly. "Okay," said Boltac, "this isn't funny anymore."

"Do it now!" Samga cried over the crackle of the lightning and the rush of superheated air.

"I can't see!" protested Boltac. And the bolts kept coming and coming. Pounding into his left arm. He could feel the glove burning his flesh. And now, tiny shocks that forced the muscles of his arm to contract and twitch violently. He turned his face away from the Wizard, still holding his hand up, and eyes closed, wincing in pain, felt on around his belt for where the wand vibrated painfully and grew hot against his skin. 

Samga heaved on the heavy shelves, and they toppled over into Dimsbury knocking him back a step. Dimsbury lashed out blindly and a bolt of electricity caught Samga in the chest. He staggered towards the Wizard once, twice and then collapsed. As Dimsbury turned back, he saw Boltac throw the wand across the room into out-of-focus flame above which Asarah dangled. 

"Ha!" cried Boltac as the wand spun through the air, in perfectly aimed arc. Dimsbury sneered and raised his hand to launch another blast at the Merchant. But as the wand entered the flame, there was a wuffing sound, and the flames of magic snapped into sharp focus. The wand was sucked into the heart of the flames and, for an instant, everything stopped moving.

"What have you done," asked Dimsbury. Then he realized he didn't care. He threw his hands forward in a gesture of power, certain to obliterate the meddling merchant from this plane of existence. Except that nothing happened. Dimsbury looked at his hands, confused. Boltac rushed to swing the apparatus from which Asarah hung out of the way. 

"Stop," commanded Dimsbury, but his voice rang hollow. "What have you done?"

Boltac did not answer. He carefully lowered Asarah to the ground. Before he could kneel to untie her, everyone became aware of a high-pitched whine rising above the sound of coins tearing at incapacitated Orcs.

Dimsbury looked at the now frozen flame. The flow of magic, yes, he thought, that's what it was. The flow of magic had stopped. Inside the still weirdly illuminated, perfect flames the wand vibrated furiously, emitting the high-pitched, rising whine that dominated the room. If Dimsbury could unblock he thought as he reached out and touched the frozen flame. As his finger brushed the surface, it cracked like impossibly fine glass, shattering into a million fragments, each of which shattered into a million fragments of it's own. 

The explosion knocked everyone flat. Asarah, of course was lying on the ground, so she was spared the brunt of the blast. Samga, surprised to have survived a bolt of lightning to his chest, had just risen to his hands and knees. He saw Dimsbury fly over his head into the wall, even as the blast wave knocked him flat. Boltac was flipped upside down and thrown into the wall. He landed in a heap next to what was left of Relan. Even the creeping coins where battered so badly, they retracted into their glittering carapaces and pretended to be currency. 

As Boltac raised his head, he heard a moan from Relan's corpse. Wait! Not a corpse. Somehow he was still alive. "Too stupid to die?" Boltac asked. Even as he searched for it in his pockets. From within the small, lacquered box he produced a tiny flask covered in ornately wrapped gold wire. No bigger than Boltac's thumb, this vial contained scarcely more moisture than could be found in a few tears. 

He looked at Relan, in an ungainly pile on the floor. The blood turning brown where it had soaked into his tunic and dried. There was no color left in his face. The boy's lips were blue with cold, yet still a the slightest of breaths fluttered his nostrils. How was it that he lived? Was this not another kind of magic? The magic of will alone?

"Kid," Boltac said softly. "C'mon, kid." He carefully removed the tiny top from the flask. Very, very carefully, he lifted the flask to Relan's blue and lifeless lips. Only the slightest flutter of air on Boltac's fingers gave him any hope that the lad was still alive. Boltac doubted that there was enough liquid to do more than wet the Relan's tongue. There was scarcely a chance that this would work at all. But there was so little chance that any of this should work, why not? Why not?

He tipped the bottle up and the few drops disappeared into the cave of Relan's mouth. 


On the other side of the room, Dimsbury felt the tingle of power dance along his limbs. The magic was back! He sat up and exclaimed, "I will have power again." Then he sneezed twice, not understanding the sharp pain that shot through his skull each time. And why did the room look differently? What was in front of his face? He brought his hand up and bumped something. The pain became excruciating, and he realized that the Merchant's wand was stuck in his eye. He collapsed back to the floor with the shock of it. But lying there, hyperventilating for a moment, he managed to calm himself. 

On the far side of the room, he could see the flame, the font of all magic, guttering and flickering as if it was to go out. No, thought Dimsbury, this could not be? How could this Merchant? This fat, ignorant, money-grubbing aberration have stopped him? Did he know what a world without magic would be like? Could such a thing even exist. For himself, and for the greater good, Dimsbury realized he must reach the flame and coax it back to a fuller life. 

As he struggled to regain his feet, a shape appeared before him. Holding his chest, Samga said, "Master," because he didn't have another name for the man who lay before him. 

"Yes, Samga, my faithful servant after all. Thank goodness I did not strike you down. Please, help me," said the Wizard, not entirely aware that he was begging.

"You made me strong," said Samga. 

"Samga, Samga. You are my finest work. All is forgiven, my creation. Move your Father closer to the flame so that I may regain and preserve my power."

Samga bent and picked up Dimsbury. He turned back towards the sputtering flame.

"Yes, good Samga. Brave Samga," whispered Dimsbury, touching the wand in his eye gingerly.

Samga looked up at the circle of heads mounted in on the wall. The broken and aborted things that had lead to him. The trial and the error, the arrogant misuse of power in an attempt to craft life itself. Not for the first time, Samga wished that he had had never been made.

"Yessss," said Dimsbury. Just a little closer. Let me dip my fingers in the torrent of magic and then, and THEN!" Dimsbury started coughing and as the pain . 

As his clacking steps took Samga closer to the flame, he lifted the Wizard high above his head. 

"What? What are you doing Samga. Lower me! The master commands!" 

"The Servant does not obey!" Samga threw the Wizard onto what was left of the magic flame. As Dimsbury landed on the the dais, with a sharp crack. Then there was a terrible tearing noise. The flames leapt up, in perfect focus. Terrible, blindingly white flames and as hungry as any real fire had ever been. Dimsbury screamed and screamed. Power shot through him and raked the top of the top of the chamber. The very Earth around them shook and still he screamed. 

And then there was a gasp. The flames folded in on themselves. With a crunching of bones and a whimpering, the Wizard folded up with them. Flickering in the magic light, tinier and tinier and tinier, until the the light of it winked out and only the light of a single torch that had not been knocked from the walls remained. 



# And a bunch of confused wolves


And a bunch of confused wolves, wondered why they had been spending so much time underground. So they followed smell of fresh air out of the depths, snarled at each other, divided up into reasonably-sized packs once again and headed out to cause no end of trouble and woe for the deer of the thick, heavily-misted forests of Robrecht. The deer had grown fat and slow and plentiful in the wolves hiatus, but now they were in for a shock. The slow would be eaten. The fast would grow faster and so, everything would return to the way it should be.



# Aftermath



Gets up and bats the rest of the flame out with the magic negating glove. 




> And where every Orc had been, there was now a greasy spot on the floor. And in the center of each greasy spot -- pure and untarnished, was a small pile of gold. About a stomachful, Boltac thought, before he could banish the strange and terrible thought from his mind. 


Untie me!

You know, you're a nice lookin' lady. 

Cut me down this instant!

Calm down, you're rescued already. Besides, we've got a man down. Boltac said, turning his attention to Relan, in a pile on the floor. All the color had drained from his face. His lips were blue with cold, yet still he drew breath. How he lived at all? Was this not another kind of magic? The magic of will alone?

Boltac knelt by him. "Kid," he said softly. "C'mon, kid." Boltac opened the small lacquered box and inside it was a tiny flask covered in ornately wrapped gold wire.


"I was dead. I thought I was dead? Wasn't I dead? And you said you didn't have any more magic potions."

"Dead? Kid, there's dead and there's dead. Besides, no matter what they tell you, there's always room for negotiation. Even with death." 

---

So, uh, Relan, how many relatives would you say you have? All unimaginative. Strong backs, just like you?

---


Nodding at the slimy hunks of Orc around them Boltac asked, "Samga, how are you not dead?"

"I do not know, I must go to ask the Underking."

"Ah, that guy. He'll have an answer, but it won't help you."







# Revisting the Troll

Melted into slag and the mace is there. Boltac picks up the mace and it doesn't pin him to the floor. 

There you go, magic is neatly dispensed with. World is a safer place. 

Asarah looked at him with a crooked sort of grin. 

"What? what's that look for?" Boltac asked.

"You're a strange sort of hero, Boltac." said Asarah. Boltac started to deny it, but Asara grabbed him and shut him up with a kiss she planted good and hard. It was the kind of kiss that stuck deep. The kind of kiss that would stay planted for years. The kind of kiss that for years to come, on cold lonely nights, Boltac would still be able to feel that kiss vibrating in his toes. 

Relan drove the coach

 But as Relan drove the coach, and they rode in the comfort of the plush interior, she planted more, just to make sure they stuck. 


# Asarah gives Boltac confidence to be king

>I can't be a king, I'm not noble. 

>We'll, if you can't be a king, then we are doomed, simply doomed to have men like him rule over us -- YOu are cheap, I will give you that Mr. Boltac. 


"You might not be able to be a King Mr. Boltac, but I could definitely be a Queen."

"But," said Boltac, "It's so much work,"

"Pfahh "

"But I wouldn't want have servants or slaves."

"Who said you have to have servant? And servants and slaves are two very different things."

"I know, dear," said Boltac.

"Aw, you called me dear."

"You don't like it?"

"No, I do. I really do." There was another kiss and then she continued. "But you don't need, servants. You don't have to force anyone to do anything. But can you just hire people to help you."

"Hire, but servants are bound to the families…"

"You know while you are daydreaming, dear, you don't have to stick to the rules of reality. And are all servants bound to "

"Wait, wait, did you say hire," Boltac said, lapsing out of the sweet trance of cuteness for the first time since they had escaped.

He leaned out of the carriage window and shouted to Relan, "Turn this thing around, we're going the wrong way!"

"But Robrecht is south!" said Relan, "If there's anything left of it."

"Yeah, I know, but to save the city we gotta go North before we go South."

"I don't understand?"

"I know. That's not your job. It's my job. And speaking of which, do you want a job? I am hiring?"

"Wait, what? But I'm an adventurer."

"And can you possibly imagine anyone else who could have taken you on a bigger adventure?"

"No," said Relan, "But you had the adventure."

"Whattya mean, you were there? You were there the whole time!"

"But you got the girl at the end. That's the way an adventure works. You get the girl at the end and live happily ever after."

"I have two things to say to that. Eh, but never mind. We don't have time. Just trust me, the adventure ain't over yet."

"But we're out of danger," said Relan.

"Trust me, what I have in mind, kid. Probably get us all killed."

"Oh," said Relan, with a smile, "then I'm in!" And he urged the horse into a gallop. 

"Okay," Boltac shouted over the rushing of the air and the thudding of the horse's hooves. "You're hired. Now don't disturb me until we get there. I've got important business back here."

"Get where?" Relan shouted. 

"Oh, you'll know when we get there. I promise." And Boltac pulled his head back in the carriage.


# Mignola Scene

> Mignola-esque shuffling off into the darkness scene so Samga can come back later. And the Orc's



In the lighter darkness Samga spoke with the elder one in the broken, hissing tongue of Orc's. (between them they try to make the language who)


For in the darker darkness he could not speak for the weight of the blackness pressing in on him from all sides. And in the darkest darkness, he feared that the blackness would fill his lungs and he would drown in night. 



And now we die. 

No, many of the husks will falter, but we will go on?

How can you be sure, I feel the beat of my heart slowing as we speak, the magic is 

The magic of man is draining out of you, but the deeper magic. The magic of life… can you feel that starting?

No. 

You have spent too much time around the human's Samga. Retreat with me into the darkness a while and I will tell you what I have learned from listening deep inside my self. 

Samga followed the older one into the darkest darkness under the ground. 

We have made choices for ourselves, we have our own spirit young one, and the thing of the spirit can never truly die. 


# The Free Companions

The free companions, I don't know why they call them that, because they sure don't come cheap. 

Whattya mean I'm not the King of Robrecht. I rode here in the King's Carriage. 

"Is that the ducal carriage?" Torvalds said with some contempt.

"No. It used to be. See, the seal has changed. I drove the Duke out and took his carriage and his castle and his town."

>"What is that sigil? A fish?"

>"An eelpout. It's like a fishes ugly cousin. And you see those words?"

>"Everybody pays their way? What kind of motto is that?"


"It is our town," sputtered Torvalds nearly incoherent with rage. 

"And you didn't drive me out. I was driven out by Orcs," protested 

"En-henh," said Boltac. "Prove it."

"Prove it?" said the ex-Duke, "Why I am a descendant of a noble line. My word is my bond."

"Not with me it ain't. I've known too many nobles. Your word and six coppers will get you a foul tasting ale at the Sign of the Bent Eelpout."

"My Gods, is that foul establishment still there?"

"It's being renovated," said Boltac.


# Boltac Catches Rattick and Makes Him His Minister


## Rattick escaping, time to head to the South -- to warmer climes

Back to Rattick's POV -- he escapes with his gold. He heads high into the mountains to a little village where he has a girl (he ha a girl in every village)

He figures things have cooled down, so he'll head South with his gold, to the Kingdoms of the Sun -- enjoy the life of luxury to which he can easily become accustomed. 

He actually makes it there (medieval Miami) and he is hit over the back of the head. Thrown in the back of the wagon. (the fog blowing through the wagon windows would have given it away if nothing else.)

He's caught at the border and hauled before the King 

"Wash yourself, you are to appear before the King."

"King of Robrecht? Everybody knows Robrecht doesn't have a King." 

Ranger cuffs him and tells him to be quiet. 


Colbac hires two legions of soliders

    "No Rattick, I don't want to trust you. I want you to try everything you possibly can. If I'm safe against my friends, I will be safe against my enemies."

    "My Lord, I am at your service."

    "And remove the sarcasm from your voice Rattick. I actually am a Lord now." He unfolded four sheets of paper. 

    He had gotten all the kingdoms to recognize him as king in return for a treaty that allied Robrecht 

    "You will go to war with everyone?"

    "No. We will be neutral."

    "Neutral," asked Rattick, "you mean as a ruse?"

    "No, I mean we will be neutral."


    And you are Lord Colbac?

    "No Rattick, I have adopted a new name constituent with my new station in life. I am the first Lord Robrecht. Now kneel before me and accept your knighthood." 

    "Knighthood?"

    "Yes Rattick. What's the matter? You think Kings shouldn't have a sense of humor."

    "This is going to be a very different sort of kingdom, my liege," Rattick said without a hint of sarcasm."

    "Yes, Rattick, it is. There's no magic anymore, Rattick. Who knows where the progress will stop."

    "Progress is magic, my liege."

    "Well spoken, Rattick. I distrust your flattery, but well spoken."

    "You are right to do so, my liege."

    "Just so."

Rattick is stopped at the border. He is dragged before the King -- turns out to be Colbac

The Merchant Heroic. The Bourgeois Heroic. The Burgher Heroic.


## Rattick at the end. 

    At the end he asks the guard why he serves a merchant, oh, well me, when there's no fighting to be done, I serve gold. But when edge meet edge, I follow courage. 

    Courage, but he's a merchant, a particularly cunning and greedy one, who drives a hard bargain. 

    He's the King -- but before that he was a hero -- do you know what he did before he became a merchant -- saved blah blah blah.  


# Boltac Confronts the Old Duke and Torvalds

"Your nephew was just lacking that special something that nobility is supposed to have."

"Courage?"

"You know, I was going to say nobility, 'cause it's sounds more poetic, but no. What you're nephew lacks is smarts. No offense your Dukedom, but ya an idiot."

"You can't talk to me like that."

"Shut up," Boltac and Torvalds said at the same time. 

"So, you know why people fight wars?"

"I fight them to win."

"Nah, what you really fight for, is a better negotiating position. And if you do it right, you don't even have to fight. Right?"

"Yes," said Torvald's through a wolf's smile, "That's close enough. You're a cunning man, it's going to be a shame to have you put to death. "

You're not in a position to negotiate

Because you have the army. 

"Yes, yes, because I have the army." Torvalds motioned for the Companions to take Boltac away. But no one moved. "Oh, you dullards, take him."

"Are you sure it's your army?"

"What do you mean, I have hired them."

"Well, about that. You haven't paid them."

"And, as it turns out, I got there first. And I had a chest fulla gold, so, uh, boys, take him a way. "

"we've got mountain passes, asshole. We're on the trade road to everywhere. And now, we've got a kingdom. And we're in business for ourselves."


# Not So Nice Ending

Boltac assumes that Asarah will be his. 

She accuses him of bargaining. Trying to buy her with his rescue attempt. But she's not up for it. It's emotionally false -- a step removed from cheating her out of a drink. You just expect. 

He somehow has to humble and humiliate himself -- or let her go. A tough emotional resolution. 

He just kisses her.




# Have to put Boltac sitting on the throne. 

Eh, this chair is not a quality item.


# End With Relan


Boltac makes him a knight.

"A knight? How can I be a knight? Don't I have to be a squire first?""

Boltac smiled at the young man, so innocent in the ways of the world, and oblivious to what had just happened, "I'm a King, and I didn't have to be a prince first. 

"But I don't know anything about being a knight!"

"I don't know anything about being a King, so we'll figure it out as we go along."

"I don't think this is a very good idea. I'm really not comfortable--"

"En-henh," said Boltac, "So you know what the first rule of being a knight is?"

"No, see, I don't even know what the first rule is!"

"The first rule is you obey the King."

"Right," Relan nodded, "obey the King."

"Now kneel and hold still so I can knight you without cutting your ear off."

"But…"

"Obey!" 




----------



"And the power. The limitless power. It should be I that make this connection with the source. Lest this power fall in to the hands of some EVIL wizard."

# Extra from Relan v. Shirley. 

Relan shook off the powerless feeling that came with the memories of being unable to rescue Sabriella. That wouldn't happen now, by the Gods. Now, things were different. Now he had a sword. Now he had boots and everything else  he could need. He had even killed an Orc. If clothes didn't make him a hero, didn't that have to? It counted for something, that was for sure. Something good.

Of course, anyone with half a brain could have seen this, but in his state, Relan didn't think of this. 




And then he was torn. Such carnage, such aggression, clearly the work of an *evil* wizard must be avenged. But Sabrellia still needed to be rescued. He stared down at the cobblestones as they passed beneath his magnificent boots and thought about it for a while. 

Then it came to him. He would do both, for both must be done. If he was to be a hero, truly be a hero, then he would have to do the hard things that other people wouldn't. But he didn't see how such a thing would be possible. 

But you broke your vows.

Sabrellia -- Stop, STOP! STOP IT! Hasn't there been enough killing? 


"It was a con. It was all a con. I was never kidnapped." 

"Never mind Sab, he's too thick to understand."

"No, he's not"

"But I loved you," Relan said, completely disarmed by this trickery. 

"I know you did"




* Have the kid find the love of his life, but the scoundrels are in on it. -- They let him know it was a con, and they are getting out. 

>But you broke your vows for me.
>I was never a real priestess.

That's what he would do. In his arrogance, he decided upon humility. He would not start off being the greatest hero ever. He would work up to it a step at a time. Helping people here and there, as the need arose. Of course, he would sally forth and destroy the Evil Wizard, that's what heroes did, but along the way he would make time to help the little people. The small folk of which he was quickly forgetting that he was one. 



  And, for the first time in his life, he walked like someone else. He had selected what he thought was the best of everything from Boltac's store. Spare no expense, for their was none!

When Boltac had left the store, Relan 

>runs into the girl and one of her accomplices, carrying two bodies in a wheelbarrow. They try to rob him. He hits the girl, then runs away. Outdistancing pursuit. 

>Confronts the con. But you told me she was trapped in a tower! 




One of the friends is wounded. 
Oh Shit! Cried one of the kidnappers!

he backhands her and runs away. Ashamed and embarrassed. 


----





"No, you are most assuredly that. The stench of the lower classes is upon you, especially your impudence."

"Impudence!" Asarah snapped, knowing it was a dangerous and stupid thing to do, but so angry at this arrogant man that she couldn't bring herself to care. 

"No I am glad you refused because now you have absolved my guilt."

"Guilt? What are you talking about? You should already feel guilty, you kidnapped me!"

"Oh, dear, no. I rescued you from a city under siege. Very sensitive and noble of me."

"You burned down my Inn!"

"Yes, well, there was that. Fit of temper. Besides, I burned up two of my sandwiches. Two sandwiches that I --"

"Didn't even pay for!"

"ENOUGH!" Dimsbury thundered, so loud that bits of rock and dust tumbled down from the vaulted ceiling of the chamber. "You were a pleasant diversion, but no more. "



* Rattick before the Wizard -- reveal that they are friends. he sets up Boltac. 
* Boltac and Relan hide from the Orc's -- have a bit of misadventure. 
* * where's Rattick -- who cares, we're pressing on. Which way? Down

>Wizard -- don't you see, your companion has betrayed you. 
>Boltac -- don't you see, that's the nice thing about making deals rather than fighting. He can't really betray me. I wanted to meet you and now I have. 
>Wizard -- And now you will die. 
>Boltac -- That might not be in your best advantage.
