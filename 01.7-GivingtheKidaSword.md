# Giving the Kid a Sword

He looked out through the thick-paned glass window at the front of his shop. The window had been quite an extravagance. Made up of 48 identically-sized pieces of hand-blown glass in a wooden frame, it was the largest window in any residence in Robrecht. Larger, by far than any windows in the keep. Large windows sort of defeated the purpose of having a keep, the whole idea being to keep arrows and other invaders out, rather than allowing them in. 

On the same principle, Boltac's store shouldn't have had such a large window. In any other store, it would have been an easy way for thieves to help themselves. A cold moonless night, a quiet shattering noise, and off goes the inventory. But Boltac's store not only housed magic items, it was a magic item of a sort. 

The bar which held the door was enchanted. And when it was in place, it rendered the entire store impervious to entrance. Of course, some one skilled in magic or learned in the way and manner of identifying items, might find a way to overcome it, but it would take more than clubs or rocks to smash this magnificent window.

After working for several months to identify the bar, he had discovered that it was a class V ward of shutting. Or, as it was known by it's original name, Ethlezar's Ward. The final test was that he barred his door with the slightly rusted piece of black steel, and then tried to hack his way through the door with a war axe. 

He had assailed the wood for the better part of an hour. When he stopped, he was tired, the axe was dull and the door was exactly the same. He then got a fresh axe and tried the other doors, a section of the wall and even one of the timbers that had framed the building.The only sign that the building had given of the powerful enchantment coursing through it, was a slight bluish glow that happened every time the axe made contact with the outside of the building. 

How it worked, he could not say, but once he had tested and classified the effects of the item, he had faith enough to install his impressive window. Of course, it had been expensive, but those were back in the good days, when a license to retail was the next best thing to a license to make coins. Now it felt like a trap. An endless bloodletting recommended by a doctor that not only didn't want to cure his patient, but wanted to kill him as slowly and painfully as possible. 

He looked across the street to the boy he had rendered unconscious. He was unmoved and Boltac would have feared him dead, if he did not see the gentle rise and fall of the young lad's chest. He remembered when he had been his age. Young and strong and fresh off a farm of his own. A farm for to the North in a particularly hard and frozen region of Mercia, but all farms are the same -- no matter what they may grow, all farms produce a surplus of hard, boring work suitable for the endless torture of young men who crave adventure. 

He did not feel guilty to braining the lad. If it was Adventure the boy was after, he would have to withstand far worse. And if his younger self had appeared by magic before him in his own store Boltac would have done far worse. He would have tried to beat some sense into his former self. Even though he doubted it could be done. 

But how could he tell a young man of the hazards that awaited him. Of the costs to life and limb and family -- all the ways of hurt and all the ways those hurts could radiate beyond himself. It was a terrible thing to be a hero. And Boltac wished the pain of it on no one. Certainly on no one's family. 

He couldn't talk him out of it. There was simply no way to frame the words, no order to put them in that could make it through his testosterone addled brain and overcome the lust for glory. Yes, if not this priestess, he would find some other cause, or scrape or trouble. At least he wasn't off in search of that Dred Wizard that all of the other 'Adventurers' were always harassing. So few of them came back. 

But, realized Boltac, there was no stopping him. So why had he tried? Maybe because he saw himself in the lad. And would have given anything and risked everything to take back the poor choices of his own youth. 

He cursed the Bards. It was surely there fault. Putting all these ideas in young men's heads. Sending them off to war or in search of gold. But even as he did, he cursed himself. 

Damn it all. Time enough for a pint. He opened the door of the store, stepped outside, stopped and then turned around. He walked back in the store, and grabbed a sword from the sword barrel. He drew the blade and tested it's balance. Awful. He sighted down the blade? As curved as a whore's back. What an awful piece of workmanship. It was the kind of item he would willingly sell to a fool, but not the kind of weapon he would wish on his worst enemy. 

A man needed a sword he could trust. Boltac saw the shape of a terrible memory rising from the dark waters of his memory. Before the thought could full take hold of him,  slammed the sword back in the barrel. 

He went to the rack behind the counter. He removed the blade from the bottom. It was the one he would of chosen, if he were spending his own money. It was a stout, Mercian sword. At one end, it's straight blade came to a broad triangular point and the other ending with a heavy round pommel that, in the hands of someone who knew what they were doing, qualified as a weapon on it's own. It sang as he unsheathed it and begged to dance in his hand. He sighted along the blade and it's hard edge was as crisp, final unforgiving as the border between this life and the next. 

It was the kind of sword Boltac would want in his hand if he was fighting for his life. And if he had had one... No. He turned away from the mugging of guilt he knew awaited him in the alley of memory. He exited, locked the shop and walked across the slop of the muddy street.

Relan was snoring softly. Probably a good sign. Boltac dropped the loop of the sword belt over he head and set the blade and scabbard in his lap. The lad didn't wake. Better that way, thought Boltac. The boy's gratitude was bound to be more annoying than his begging. 

Intent on a dinner and a pint, he pushed his way into the inn. On second though, a lot of pints. The night was long and the well of memory was deep. Best not to play any games.

Across the street, he could still see the boy, Relan? Yes, he thought it was Relan, asleep on the bench in front of the inn. How peaceful he looked. Boltac hoped that he wasn't dead. He hadn't hit him that hard, had he? And if the lad couldn't survive a tap like that, than his adventures would be short and predictable indeed. Gah, the stupidity of youth.

finding out that an item was magic was just the beginning. It might well have power, but what was the power and how was it used. Many men had lost lives carelessly playing with items beyond their ken. It was a dangerous business, which called for patient and cautious work. 

Luckily, for Boltac, Robrecht had a fine library. Many was the hour he would while away in the library, reading through the ancient histories, scattered lore and tale of bards gone by. It was how he had learned his trade, his real trade, the identification and mastery of magical items. He, himself did not have an ounce or iota of magic in him. But he had come to know it's workings and it's fashions all the same. 

There were the standard spells and alchemy. Spells of fireball, spells of ward and lock, potions of healing, of mana, of speed -- these were the stock-in-trade of lesser wizards. But each generation a few true Wizards would come along. They were the one's that expanded the boundaries of what was possible. Who crafted
