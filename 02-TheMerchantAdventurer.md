# The Merchant Adventurer



Instead of returning to the store, he trudged into the inn.

Smell of wood smoke, roasting meat and fine ale wrapped his senses in a comforting hug. On the left was a bar running the length of the building. To the left a common room with tables. Mostly empty now, given the hour of the day and the state of the town. But in the far corner, five people sat at one of the large round tables and clanked there tankards together. 

"Huzzah," they cried, "To us, the conquering heroes!"

Gah, thought Boltac, more adventurers. Mithras save us from this plague of adventurers. They had little enough money when the descended upon the town, but after they drank what little they came with they either made an ill-advised

Hero, thought Boltac, was just another word for a misfit who couldn't find a honest purpose in the world. He had known fighters in his time, some of them good. But all of the real ones had fought for loyalty or a steady paycheck. And these creatures, that drank and boasted in taverns, while they worked up the nerve -- who's bodies littered the countryside, dismembered in terrible and remarkable ways. Who only served to aggravate the Dread Wizard Oddna -- and really was he Dread? Maybe he just wanted to be left alone. To forget his past in where ever it was he came from -- that was a good a reason as any to come to the mountains of High Robrecht.

Goes to bar. Asks asarah is he can borrow an ale. 

"I hate to think what condition you'll give it back to me." She quipped. And the. She smiled. And just like that, gravity was a little lighter and he forgot the problems of the world for a little while. 

"Don't worry, it will be liquid."

And then, miracle of miracles, she laughed.  She she shook her head and as he long black hair rippled like waves through the water the crusty old merchant melted and for just a second you could see the little boy inside. 

Then she broke the spell by asking, "but seriously 'Tac" what's gotten into you?"

"Oh, he said, running a hand through his thinning hair in frustration, "this kid just came into my store asking to borrow a sword."

What? You mean like you'd borrow a cup of sugar. 

Yes, exactly. Except when you borrow a cup of sugar, you don't go off and use it to get yourself kills trying to save some damn fool... 
What?

Priestess of Dar. 

"Oh, virgin love," she said with a look in her eye that made Boltac realize, telling the truth about the less than virginal priestess was the wrong thing to do. 

"Hmmm," he said into his beer. 

"So, did you loan him the sword?"

"No," snapped Boltac, foam flying from his lips. "I hit him over the head with a club, dragged him across the street and left him unconscious on the bench out front."

Now her eyes flashed dark against the wave of her hair. "How *could* you?" 

"It was easy, actually, I just took my..." he trailed off, realizing that he just waded too deeply into the wrong answer. It did not pay to upset the only licensed provider of ale for 10 miles around, so he tried again. "Look, woman," realizing that he had gone even farther wrong as he said it, "What do you think monsters in that dungeon would have done to him. What do you think that wizard would have done. It's no pink tea you know. "

"Wouldn't you go?"

"No I wouldn't"

"And you *do* realize what it means?" she asked, laughing at him. 

He's zero mostel

Rattick is Peter Lorre

The kid is...

THe duke is the guy from Best in Show...

Oddna is Peter Guest

Boltac stands up to a guy much taller than he is.

Next bit -- hates himself for getting his hopes up. -- he knocks the kid unconscious -- drags him across to the inn and props him on the bench. 

Gets a beer, flirts with Asarah -- talks about how bad business has been. They talk about heroes -- he's bleak, "Why if it wasn't for you good Red ale and your mutton sandwiches, I might give up hope altogether" he said, shocked to hear the truth from his own mouth. 

Rattick comes to sell an item -- she says, see things are looking up. 

They go across the street -- Rattick leaves -- Boltac watches him go -- sees the boy -- gives him the sword. Comes back, there is a handmaiden there. She seeks a dagger for protection. 




As he enjoys his beer, Rattick bends his ear a little. Seed the heroes

the store is dark brown, age polished wood, with a fireplace providing what little heat there is. There are windows of hand-blown glass.

It was not a large store, but every square inch of it was packed with merchandise of one kind or another. Here were torches or various grades and sizes, a lantern that glowed when it came into proximitity with danger

By the door there was a bucket of used swords. There were spears, just for show, for dungeons and treasure hordes were confined spaces -- not the kind of space

 For all he knew it could have been there for years. Maybe it was back at the beginning of it all. Back when times were good and the money and goods had flowed freely. 

Colbac slid his dirk out of it's sheath and placed the point beside the coin. As he did, he heard the door open. His heart leapt with the thought that a customer had walked in the store. But other, more practical parts of him loathed the kind of person who walked into his store these days. 

It is difficult to be a shopkeeper who hates his clientle. 

For Colbac's customers weren't what they once were. 






---
He had devolved from a purveyor of fine merchandise to traders and noblemen, to an outfiter. 

----

For the the 15th time today, Colbac looked down at the coin wedged between the dark, oak floorboards of his shop. It was a [shilling], not worth much. And it was so well-wedged in between the floorboards that Colbac believed to get it out would damage the floor more than the coin itself was worth. 

He remembered when that coin had found it's way into that crack. Those were busier times. He had spent his days rushing to and fro, helping the constant stream of noble customers that formed his clientle. For some it was spices from the East. For others the luxurious garments of silk that were woven only in the South. The men of the North brought furs that the locals prized highly. And all the finest homes were furnished with the choices items from the west. 
In those days, many a coin found it's way to the floor amidt the hustle of business. And he remembered stepping on this one and feeling it slip into the crack. 

Now it gleamed at him from the darkness beneath his counter, a reminder of how good things had been, and how bad they were now. A dark shadow had fallen across the Kingdom of Robrecht. The once proud trading post nestled in the high mountains at the intersection of the North road and the West Road (as the population to the South and East knew them) or the South Road and the East Road (as those to North and the West named them) 

But one thing everyone agreed upon. In those days, Robrecht was at the center of everything. And at the center of Robrecht had been Colbac's store. 

Now he was lucky if a new day brought new coins. Or customer's at all. 

Colbac had slid down the retail ladder. He purveyed goods of the highest quality for the most discerning of customers. But now he had become a purveyor, a mere outfitter. 

A powerful wizard had taken up residence in an abandoned mine to the North. This, in itself, was not the tragedy.

He gives the kid a sword.

He takes the kid with him.


In the middle of everything there is a small kingdom known as Robrecht. That it is a very small Kingdom is a fact often overlooked by the history book, as it is a place which gained much of it's importance from it's placement. It is in the middle of the continent, in the middle of a mountain range -- in fact, it even got started in the middle of a river. 

But that is a story for another time, what is important right now is that Robrecht (pronounced Raw-brecht) is even the middle of a mess.
