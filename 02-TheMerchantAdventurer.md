# The Merchant Adventurer

# Chapter 1 - The Bad Penny/A Plague of Heroes

Boltac decided, this was the day he was finally going to get that damned coin. He heaved his bulk off the stool, slid his dirk free of his sheathe, and grunted as he lowered himself to his hands and knees. His knees made explosive popping noises. Not for the first time today, he thought,"I'm old."

In what little light that penetrated beneath his thick, oaken shop counter, He could make out the copper coin gleaming at him from the gap in the floorboards where it had been lodged. 

He hadn't remembered dropping it. But as long as he could remember, it had been there. Likely it was back from when times were good. There were a lot more coins to drop back then. 

He had let it sit there for many years on the basis that tearing up his floor and having it repaired would cost more than one copper coin. A store was in the business of making money, and wasting good coin on a floor repair that a customer would never see didn't make good sense. 

Even though this was true, the coin had still worried Boltac. And in return, he had worried it. As he sat at his stool, or stood at the counter, conducting trade, he would rub the coin with his foot. As one might absent-mindedly tongue at a loose tooth until it came free.

But this coin never loosened in it's socket. If anything it seemed to be burrowing deeper and deeper into the floor. And years of obsessive rubbing had left the top of the coin as bright as if it had newly minted. 

If it was a constant reminder of what a profit was, and underscored that Boltac had not turned one for many years. Not since things had turned bad. 

He placed the point of the dirk into the grain close to the side of the coin. Of course, this would leave an unsightly tear in his otherwise pristine shop floor, but Boltac didn't care. Even though he didn't have the money it would take to fix it, he was sick of the penny's constant taunting. 

Even rubbing it had cost him money. Three times he had his boots resoled because he had worn out the right toe rubbing that damned penny. And he needed to get them resoled again, but things had gotten so bad, even the bootmaker had left town. A sad, yet succinct commentary on the state of the town of Robrecht.

Boltac didn't know what fresh disappointments the future would bring, but today, he would have his revenge. He raised the knife. He squinted as he took aim. He imagined the shock he would feel along his arm and the satisfying thud he would make as he dug out a chip of wood. 

But before he could deliver the coup de grace, he heard the front door open. 

"Nnnnngh," Boltac said with obvious disgust, "A customer."

He rose up from behind the counter, still clutching the knife. He tried, but failed in his effort to untwist the scowl on his face as he asked, "Can I help you... sir?" The only sincerity in whole display was in the knife. It was reassuringly and unambiguously sharp. 

Near the door, looking unsure of himself, was a young man with broad shoulders and an unruly mop of long, blonde hair. He stammered, "I, uh, uh, I" he said eyes locked on the knife. 

Boltac replaced the blade in his sheath, clapped his hands together as if to dispel evil spirits. He smiled with such effort it made his face hurt and tried again, "Welcome to Boltac's General Store and Dungeon Outfittery. We have everything that a strapping young adventurer like yourself could need to loot your way to fame and glory."

"We?" asked the lad, with the kind of farm-fresh innocence that comes from hard work, clean living and getting kicked in the head by livestock. 

"Yes, the Royal We, or, in this case, the Shopkeeper's We."

"But there is only one of you," said the lad, obviously confused.

"Yes, but," Boltac ground his molars together for a second. "I am very eager to help you. What do you need?"

"I am about to embark on an adventure of high purpose and consequence." With this last phrase, Boltac's hopes lifted. These fancy words sounded like coin. Perhaps this was the customer -- the one that would break the shadow of bad luck the store and city had been under. Perhaps, perhaps, he had money to spend after all.  

"Ah yes, well, you have come to the right place."

"I hope so, sir. As it is the only place in town."

"Yes, the Duke of Robrecht himself has granted me license to purvey. He has an eye to quality, his Dukeship does, and with his warrant of commerce he personally guarantees that this," he indicated his dark, dusty store with an expansive gesture of his hands, "Is the finest merchandise you can buy in town of Robrecht."

"But it's the only merchandise I can buy in the town of Robrecht."

"Yes, I see that you are a quick study," said Boltac, directing the young man through the shelves. "I invite you to direct your keen wit towards my wares. Here we have an assortment of torches and oil bearing devices. If you notice this one, with the curved blade on the handle -- particularly good when you are surprised coming around a corner.

"Here, of course, we have our major and minor healing potions. A must for any prudent adventurer. These potions are brewed by the finest Mercian apothecaries and brought in by mule train once a moon. 

"Armor, a 

"And of course, swords. There are, various schools of thoughts on weapons. Some prefer pikes, some care for bows, but I am a traditionalist. A good dagger on one hip, a good sword on the other, and there's not much a man isn't ready for. And this," Boltact said with hushed tones of awe

"Well, that's no trouble at all," he said, "we have a number of fine weapons, made by lesser known craftsmen -- most never tested, but the mores the glory when the blade becomes famous in your hand, eh?" Boltac swung and indicated the rack of sheathed blades that extended from ceiling to floor. 

Again the young man winced. "Uh, I'm afraid..."

Boltac's smile collapse in upon itself like the poorly constructed thing it was. He shuffled over to the door and kicked a barrel filled with swords -- some still bloody, all of them nicked, none of which had sheathes. "There's always our discount barrel."


{

i've been trying to save money to buy the sword, sir. Scrounging for herbs, seeing if anyone needs rats killed. But the countryside is bare for miles around... he trailed off 

And, thought Boltac, there's not a coin left among the good (or, more to the point, morally questionable folk of Robrect to pay for pest control -- and worse, any rat that dare show it's tail has been snatched up, cooked and eaten by any one of the horde of ill-prepared adventurers who have descended upon the land seeking fortune and glory. )

They died in droves. They died in hordes. They died on the roads. Some drank themselves to death. They came back horribly wounded or touched in the brain, cluttered the thoroughfare. 

The wizard, perhaps, was an evil -- but this was certainly a plague of heroes. 

}


"I need to rent a sword," he said. 


"RENT A SWORD?" Boltac shouted. "Do you not see the sign?" he asked pointing at the sign which clearly read "All Sales Final."

"I can't read, sir."

"Oh, of course not."

"Please sir, it's so I can rescue the love of my life. She was taken, you see. By the evil wizard Oddna."

"Oh well, that changes everything," said Colbac, as his face grew hard. "Tell me more," he said, as if it was a dare.

"Well sir, she is a priestess of Dar. And, well,"

"Aren't they supposed to be virgins? Them priestesses of Dar."

The young man blushed and said, "It's more of a suggestion, than a rule, sir. If you know what I mean," his face grew serious, "but if it helps, I was a virgin, if you catch my drift."

"Help? How would that help?"

"She's gone and got herself into trouble. In the underkeep I mean. And if I had a sword, I could go and rescue her."

"Oh lad, if you had a sword, I'm sure you could. In fact, a big strong lad like yourself could probably manage it with your bare hands."

The boy looked shocked, "No sir, I could never..."

"Well, then, I suggest you find yourself another Priestess of the Eternal Flame of Questionable virtue."

"What are you saying? Look, if you are insulting the virtue of my young--"

Colbac slammed a club of knotty wood down upon his counter. "You'll WHAT?" he asked with great relish. He secretly hoping the boy would do something stupid so that he could vent his spleen. 

In a quiet voice the lad said, "I'm not asking for a discount. It's just a loan."

"It's the worst kind of discount of all," shrieked Colbac, "It's a 100% discount."

"But I'd bring it back. Maybe with a few nicks, but definitely covered in glory."

"Oh Glory is it? That would enhance the retail value."

"Yes, yes," he said eagerly, unaware of the trap he was falling into.

"Because you are such a great fighter."

"Yes, that's it."

"Powerful, strong," Colbac prompted.

"Yes."

"Well then, how about this?" Colbac slowly lifted the club off of his counter and held it above his head. He watched as the young "fighter's" trusting, cow-like eyes followed the weapons movement. Then, without the any hesitation of remorse or conscience, he dropped the heavy, burlwood shaft down on the top of his unarmored head. 
. 

As the lad collapsed to the floor unconscious, Colbac felt secure in the knowledge that he had done him a favor as well as a concussion. 

No, thought Colbac, you're no kind of fighter at all. Too earnest. Too willing to play by the rules. You won fights by cheating. And heroes cheated more than anybody. No, the young lad was better off unconscious, at least he wouldn't get his fool self killed by running off in the the dungeon. 

Colbac came out from behind his counter and dragged the boy outside. By the scruff of his neck. Colbac was not pretty, he was not graceful, but he was strong. He dragged the lad across the street and propped him up next to a drunk who was sitting on the bench in front of the Inn. Ah, what adventuring lies they would tell each other when they woke up. 

<!-- chapter break -->


Instead of returning to the store, he trudged into the inn.

Smell of wood smoke, roasting meat and fine ale wrapped his senses in a comforting hug. On the left was a bar running the length of the building. To the left a common room with tables. Mostly empty now, given the hour of the day and the state of the town. But in the far corner, five people sat at one of the large round tables and clanked there tankards together. 

"Huzzah," they cried, "To us, the conquering heroes!"

Gah, thought Boltac, more adventurers. Mithras save us from this plague of adventurers. They had little enough money when the descended upon the town, but after they drank what little they came with they either made an ill-advised

Hero, thought Boltac, was just another word for a misfit who couldn't find a honest purpose in the world. He had known fighters in his time, some of them good. But all of the real ones had fought for loyalty or a steady paycheck. And these creatures, that drank and boasted in taverns, while they worked up the nerve -- who's bodies littered the countryside, dismembered in terrible and remarkable ways. Who only served to aggravate the Dread Wizard Oddna -- and really was he Dread? Maybe he just wanted to be left alone. To forget his past in where ever it was he came from -- that was a good a reason as any to come to the mountains of High Robrecht.

Goes to bar. Asks asarah is he can borrow an ale. 

"I hate to think what condition you'll give it back to me." She quipped. And the. She smiled. And just like that, gravity was a little lighter and he forgot the problems of the world for a little while. 

"Don't worry, it will be liquid."

And then, miracle of miracles, she laughed.  She she shook her head and as he long black hair rippled like waves through the water the crusty old merchant melted and for just a second you could see the little boy inside. 

Then she broke the spell by asking, "but seriously 'Tac" what's gotten into you?"

"Oh, he said, running a hand through his thinning hair in frustration, "this kid just came into my store asking to borrow a sword."

What? You mean like you'd borrow a cup of sugar. 

Yes, exactly. Except when you borrow a cup of sugar, you don't go off and use it to get yourself kills trying to save some damn fool... 
What?

Priestess of Dar. 

"Oh, virgin love," she said with a look in her eye that made Boltac realize, telling the truth about the less than virginal priestess was the wrong thing to do. 

"Hmmm," he said into his beer. 

"So, did you loan him the sword?"

"No," snapped Boltac, foam flying from his lips. "I hit him over the head with a club, dragged him across the street and left him unconscious on the bench out front."

Now her eyes flashed dark against the wave of her hair. "How *could* you?" 

"It was easy, actually, I just took my..." he trailed off, realizing that he just waded too deeply into the wrong answer. It did not pay to upset the only licensed provider of ale for 10 miles around, so he tried again. "Look, woman," realizing that he had gone even farther wrong as he said it, "What do you think monsters in that dungeon would have done to him. It's no pink tea you know. "




"Wouldn't you go?"


"No I wouldn't"



"And you *do* realize what it means?" she asked, laughing at him. 

Boltac didn't say anything. He looked away and his eyes unfocused as the memories tried to come flooding back. He took a long pull on the ale, gulping down nearly half of it. 

"If you please, good merchant, I have something I would like to sell," a snake whispered in Boltac's ear and broke the spell. 

He turned to his right and beheld Rattick, too large and too watery eyes trying to fool him with their great sincerity. The glowed like great moons of reassurance. So dazzling they were that it was difficult to notice the pale, dead face that never smiled around them. Or, Boltac assumed, the knife that was coming to slit the strings on your coinpurse. 

"Ah Rattick," he said, "Have you taken those poor fools last coin before they could drink it." 

"No," Rattick sighed with great sincerity, "but if I had, just if mind you, would that be so terrible? So parasitic? After all, we are all suffering from an economic downturn of such proportion, such magnitude, that bringing coin here to Robrecht and keeping it here, why it is a matter of our very survival. 

"Economic? That's a very large word for you Rattick," Boltac said. 

"You should not be so unkind to me, stout merchant. Besides, it would be a sin to let them take their coin with them on their planned outing 

"It seems a sin to let them wander off into the hills and die, leaving their remaining coin festering at the bottom of some dark fen, troll pit or bottomless chasm." At this, Boltac clinked glasses with the weasel of a man sitting next to him. He might have been shady, disreputable, but he wasn't wrong. Besides, the man was thief. It was his job. And unlike all of the other adventurers who festered and waited in Robrecht -- Rattick was actually good at what he did. 

"Yes, you see that one there," Rattick continued, "The one with the pan for a helmet. Yes, he is the *chosen one*."

"Ah, of course, sent to to free us from the awful shadow of the wizard who has occupied the nearby tower."

"Cavern, actually. Rumor has it the old Matteschitz mine collapsed into a gigantic, secret cavern in the earth."

"Oh, ah, of course. Cavern. How silly of me," said Boltac.

"And even know, the great wizard Oddna searches beneath the earth for relics and powers of which man was not meant to know." 

"Which, will inevitably bring about the destruction of all of the Duchy of Robrecht," said Boltac, filling in the next verse. And recognizing it for the lie it was. He had never met the Wizard Oddna, and hoped he never would -- he hated magic in a way that only a trader with a lust for certain, right and ordinary commerce can. -- but if a man wanted to dig for objects in the earth, why shouldn't he? As for the tales of horrible things happening and monsters roaming the land, Boltac couldn't help but notice that these stories, and the twisted corpses and wrecked adventurers who had retunred, had only started turning up after adventurers had gone out in search of Oddna's loot. Boltac knew what he would do to anyone he caught robbing his store...

"Yes, but of course. But thankfully, the chosen one is here to save us."

"Hmm, thankfully."

"Only, there is one, unexpected problem for this auspicious young man on his world-healing hero quest."

"Yes,"

"You see the tall one, in the Mage's robe."

"Yes, the one covered in silly mystical symbols as only a true mage can be?"

"Yes. Turns out, he's the chosen one. Too."

"Ahh, so the chosen two."

"Yes, I fear it will not end well for their party, but enough of the misfortunes of others. I have a certain item that I have come into possession of a certain item which I am certain you will be interested."

"Step into my office," said Boltac, as he slid off the stool and made his way to the door. But not before casting a longing look towards the kitchen. What would 

CH 3 -- the problem with magic items

---

Asarah -- but you see that's how she knows he loves her. He comes for her, risks everything against all odds for the love of his life. 

Boltac -- that's how she knows he's an idiot. 

Asarah -- You're a bitter, bitter man. 

Boltac -- What because I make good sense?

Asarah -- Because there's no romance in your life. No passion. No magic. 

Ugh, thought Boltac. Magic that's worse than romance

---


-Isn't that right, Asarah?" but when he turned back, she was gone.

He's zero mostel

Rattick is Peter Lorre

The kid is...

THe duke is the guy from Best in Show...

Oddna is Peter Guest

Boltac stands up to a guy much taller than he is.

Next bit -- hates himself for getting his hopes up. -- he knocks the kid unconscious -- drags him across to the inn and props him on the bench. 

Gets a beer, flirts with Asarah -- talks about how bad business has been. They talk about heroes -- he's bleak, "Why if it wasn't for you good Red ale and your mutton sandwiches, I might give up hope altogether" he said, shocked to hear the truth from his own mouth. 

Rattick comes to sell an item -- she says, see things are looking up. 

They go across the street -- Rattick leaves -- Boltac watches him go -- sees the boy -- gives him the sword. Comes back, there is a handmaiden there. She seeks a dagger for protection. 




As he enjoys his beer, Rattick bends his ear a little. Seed the heroes

the store is dark brown, age polished wood, with a fireplace providing what little heat there is. There are windows of hand-blown glass. 


--



It was not a large store, but every square inch of it was packed with merchandise of one kind or another. Here were torches or various grades and sizes, a lantern that glowed when it came into proximitity with danger

By the door there was a bucket of used swords. There were spears, just for show, for dungeons and treasure hordes were confined spaces -- not the kind of space 








---
 For all he knew it could have been there for years. Maybe it was back at the beginning of it all. Back when times were good and the money and goods had flowed freely. 

Colbac slid his dirk out of it's sheath and placed the point beside the coin. As he did, he heard the door open. His heart leapt with the thought that a customer had walked in the store. But other, more practical parts of him loathed the kind of person who walked into his store these days. 

It is difficult to be a shopkeeper who hates his clientle. 

For Colbac's customers weren't what they once were. 






---
He had devolved from a purveyor of fine merchandise to traders and noblemen, to an outfiter. 

----

For the the 15th time today, Colbac looked down at the coin wedged between the dark, oak floorboards of his shop. It was a [shilling], not worth much. And it was so well-wedged in between the floorboards that Colbac believed to get it out would damage the floor more than the coin itself was worth. 

He remembered when that coin had found it's way into that crack. Those were busier times. He had spent his days rushing to and fro, helping the constant stream of noble customers that formed his clientle. For some it was spices from the East. For others the luxurious garments of silk that were woven only in the South. The men of the North brought furs that the locals prized highly. And all the finest homes were furnished with the choices items from the west. 
In those days, many a coin found it's way to the floor amidt the hustle of business. And he remembered stepping on this one and feeling it slip into the crack. 

Now it gleamed at him from the darkness beneath his counter, a reminder of how good things had been, and how bad they were now. A dark shadow had fallen across the Kingdom of Robrecht. The once proud trading post nestled in the high mountains at the intersection of the North road and the West Road (as the population to the South and East knew them) or the South Road and the East Road (as those to North and the West named them) 

But one thing everyone agreed upon. In those days, Robrecht was at the center of everything. And at the center of Robrecht had been Colbac's store. 

Now he was lucky if a new day brought new coins. Or customer's at all. 

Colbac had slid down the retail ladder. He purveyed goods of the highest quality for the most discerning of customers. But now he had become a purveyor, a mere outfitter. 

A powerful wizard had taken up residence in an abandoned mine to the North. This, in itself, was not the tragedy.

He gives the kid a sword.

He takes the kid with him.


In the middle of everything there is a small kingdom known as Robrecht. That it is a very small Kingdom is a fact often overlooked by the history book, as it is a place which gained much of it's importance from it's placement. It is in the middle of the continent, in the middle of a mountain range -- in fact, it even got started in the middle of a river. 

But that is a story for another time, what is important right now is that Robrecht (pronounced Raw-brecht) is even the middle of a mess.
