The Troll had ingested three normal-sized humans, and as such, was a little bloated. He dragged himself along the dark stone hallway as best he could, but the strain in his abdominal muscles and the inherent sleepiness that comes after a heavy meal, slowed him greatly. The bump in his distended, warty stomach was so big that he had to move his left hip around lunch, rather than walking straight through the natural arc of motion. 

A few minutes into his retreat into darkness, he began to feel a nauseous. That always happened when he ate too fast. The strips of leather kit and armor never agreed with him. Many of his relatives thought him weak, but none of them had ever accidentally eaten and passed a codpiece. 

The Troll grabbed the stitch in his side and thought eagerly of this bed that lay but three levels below in the catacombs. When the TROLL had moved in, this had once a thriving district. But since then much of the dungeon had moved away -- and more of it had fallen into decline.

The entrance to the Wizard's lair was three days into the mountain. As he walked up into the mountains, the years fell off him. By the second day his limp had disappeared and he felt better than he had felt in ages. He thought his body had grown infirm from the weight of the years, but it weak and pained from neglect rather than strain.

He bent to drink in a mountain stream and felt something wild stirring within him. He was unfettered, free. And not in the least because he believed himself going to his own death. But he was going as a free man, unencumbered. He was somewhat ashamed to admit, for all the disdain he had heaped on others, on an *adventure*.

Historically, the ruler of the land called Robrecht had two choices. First, to declare himself a king and then in some way or another fight all four neighboring kingdoms. Or take the more humble title of Duke and then declare allegiance to one or more of the four neighboring kingdoms -- thus gaining support against the others, and fighting less. 

It was a tenous position in the best of times, but when the fucking wizard showed up -- forget about it.

## Chapter 1

Colbac was eating a mutton sandwich from the Inn across the street. The Inn, which was the only Inn in town, in the same way that Colbac's was the only store in town, was justly famous for a full range of mutton dishes. Quite improbably these included a  mutton tort with a honey glaze that was one of the chief reasons Colbac was as wide as he was tall. Well, that and the Ale. 

Colbac lifted a tankard of the good red ale and washed down a mouthful of greasy meat. There was a time when he would not have eaten and drank alone at the end of a working day. He would have come out from behind his thick oak counter, flipped the sign in the window, activated the charm of warding and gone across the street to sit by the roaring fire, eat, drink and otherwise be merry. But those days were past. Now Colbac opened early and closed late. And the only time he saw a serving wench was when she brought him dinner. 
It was the adventurer's who had ruined it all. This had been such a nice town. Colbac had had such a nice store. But when a foul and black-hearted wizard had taken up residence in a nearby complex of underground caverns, things had started to turn. 

A wizard was bad enough, what with the destruction of crops, the mutilation of cattle, the disruption of weather patterns, the disappearance of virgins... a whole host and swarm of villainies were blamed on the nearby wizard. 

At first, Colbac suspected that the wizard might have been little more than a convenient scapegoat for the troubles of the simple-minded villagers. But as time passed, he realized that he had been wrong. Every Wizard worth his salt has a gimmick, you see. A signature theme to the magic that he does. Many great and powerful wizards have never amounted to much in the wizarding world because they could never find a proper of consistent theme for their oveure. 

For example, Venario, an enchanter who had installed himself in a tower far to the North, had found a theme in his strange and sinister sense of humor. He created some of the finest magical items the world had ever known, but the power and perfection of his enchantments were each directed into a completely counter-productive, ironic and often embarrassing purpose. 

It was not enough for the Great Giambanista Venario to cause a sword to be less likely to cut it's foe or an arrow to be less likely to find it's mark. God's no! That was the stuff of village witches. Merely parlor tricks compared to the great body of work that Venario had dedicated his life to enchanting. 

The new Wizard had taken an unusual and fairly destructive theme. He was a breeder, keeper and trainer of all kind of creatures. In his massive underground lair he kept a managerie of such variety and horror that, in the end, all the blame heaped on his name turned out to be deserve. Never let it be said, that Oddna didn't earn his terrible reputation.

But as bad as Oddna was, he was less damaging to the town than the plague of adventurers who descended upon it. They ruined the pleasant life in the otherwise quiet town. And they angered the wizard and his minons with their countless, pointless, hopeless forays into the Wizard's demesne. 

Angry minions, of course, lash out in greater and greater numbers for greater distances. Which, of course, calls forth bigger idiots who imagined themselves bigger heroes. The whole thing escalated in a vicious cycle until all of the outlying villages has been raised. 

Of course, the other townspeople didn't see it that way. They thought themselves beset upon by great an sinister forces. And those who came to aid the town in it's time of trial were great heroes. They were to be toasted, to be fete'd to be treated as the last great hope for the redemption of the town. No matter that what few virgins were left in the vicinity disappeared at an alarming rate. No matter that each party that set out, no matter how promising they seemed, they all met with slaughter. 

One night, deep in his cups, Borlag, the innkeeper had confided in him, "It's not like "

Colbac found the whole thing ghoulish. 

But of course that wasn't the real reason  <!-- Leave this as the hook for the story of the young girl. Colbac had once been a fighter, but he had been lamed by a  -->

And it didn't hurt that they were such a stimulus to the local economy. The Innkeeper, Borlag, grew fat and rich off his sale of fermented grain. He even changed the name of the place from "The Flaming Sparrow", to "The Adventurer's Inn". 

All of this was good for Colbac's business, but bad for his soul. Everyday he saw 

Why no one commented


As much as he hated them, they had been great for Colbac's business

<!-- 
Colbac had a special grudge against Venario, and knew his work better than anyone else in the kingdom. As the only outfitter for miles around, Colbac had outfitted every party of adventurers who had gone looking for glory, riches and trouble for as long as anyone could remember. Mostly, the adventurers found trouble. Even when they thought they had found riches. 
 -->

Halfway through his sandwich, the bell on the door rang, signifying that a customer had entered. Colbac grumbled through his dinner, washed it down with a swig of ale and mustered his signature brand of customer service.

"What do you want?" he demanded of the poor specimen who now clogged his showroom. 

"Please sir," the man in the cheap armor began.

Colbac held up a hand and said, "No."

"But you don't even know what I am going to ask."

"And I don't want to know. Do you see that?" He pointed at a sign on the wall that read, "No Discounts"

"I can't read..." said the young man, looking at the floor awkwardly.

"'Course not," said Colbac, "and why should you put the effort into acquiring such a useless skill?"

The young, almost-fighter ventured a half-smile. 

Colbac was not charmed. "I mean, wearing armor like that, you're life expectancy isn't long enough to finish a magazine, let alone a proper book."

"Pleas sir," the young fighter tried, attempting to make up with perseverance what he lacked in rhetorical skill. 

"Boy, go back to you your hovel," said Colbac.

"But, I need to borrow a sword, sir. Just for a day or so."

"BORROW? A SWORD!" Colbac said in such a voice as to make the strong, but poorly equipped young man flinch. 

"Y-y-y-yes sir. It's so I can rescue the love of my life."

"Oh well, that changes everything," said Colbac, as his face grew hard in the harsh light of his cheap torches. "Tell me more," he said, as if it was a dare.

"Well sir, she is a priestess of Dar. And, well,"

"Aren't they supposed to be virgins? Them priestesses of Dar."

The young man blushed and said, "WIt's more of a suggestion, than a rule, sir. If you know what I mean," his face grew serious, "but if it helps, I was a virgin, if you catch my drift."

"Help? How would that help?"

"She's gone and got herself into trouble. In the underkeep I mean. And if I had a sword, I could go and rescue her."

"Oh lad, if you had a sword, I'm sure you could. In fact, a big strong lad like yourself could probably manage it with your bare hands."

The boy looked shocked, "No sir, I could never..."

"Well, then, I suggest you find yourself another Priestess of the Eternal Flame of Questionable virtue."

"What are you saying. Look, if you are insulting the virtue of my young--"

Colbac slammed a club of knotty wood down upon his counter. "You'll WHAT?" he asked with great relish? Hoping the boy would do something stupid so that he could vent his spleen. 

In a quiet voice the lad said, "I'm not asking for a discount. It's just a loan."

"It's the worst kind of discount of all," shrieked Colbac, "It's a 100% discount."

"But I'd bring it back. Maybe with a few nicks, but definitely covered in glory."

"Oh Glory is it? That would enhance the retail value."

"Yes, yes," he said eagerly, unaware of the trap he was falling into. 

"Because you are such a great fighter."

"Yes, that's it."

"Powerful, strong," Colbac prompted.

"Yes."

"Well then, how about this?" Colbac slowly lifted the club off of his counter and held it above his head. He watched as the young "fighter's" trusting, cow-like eyes followed the weapons movement. Then, without the any hesitation of remorse or conscience, he dropped the heavy, burlwood shaft down on the top of his unarmored head. 
. 

As the lad collapsed to the floor unconscious, Colbac felt secure in the knowledge that he had done him a favor as well as a concussion. 

No, thought Colbac, you're no kind of fighter at all. Too earnest. Too willing to play by the rules. You won fights by cheating. And heroes cheated more than anybody. No, the young lad was better off unconscious, at least he wouldn't get his fool self killed by running off in the the dungeon. 

Colbac came out from behind his counter and dragged the boy outside. By the scruff of his neck. Colbac was not pretty, he was not graceful, but he was strong. He dragged the lad across the street and propped him up next to a drunk who was sitting on the bench in front of the Inn. Ah, what adventuring lies they would tell each other when they woke up. 

His good deed done for the day, Colbac rubbed his mouth and decided he had earned another tankard of ale. He steeled his nerve and pushed though the door of the inn. 

The inside was dark and smokey. The smells of beer and body odor jockeyed for position in Colbac's nostrils. In spite of himself, he winced. As his eyes adjusted to the darkness of the common room, he saw a band of adventurers he had not yet seen begging for change around the town. Adventurer, of course, was a polite synonym for broke with no prospects of employment. 

In the far corner of the room, Shanallanon, the local excuse for a bard was doing


Ah, Ethline, you're a sight for parched eyes. When are you going to come to your senses and get rid of the vagrants so we can enjoy our quiet talks together."

"And, by quiet talks you'd mean you sitting on a stool, muttering into your pint why I "

"As long as they've got coin."

"Yes, as long as they've the coin," she conceded.

"Which, judging by the poor quality of their equipage, shouldn't be but for one or two more rounds."

"Oh, leave them be. They're young and off in search of adventure. Besides, you're just jealous."

This turn of conversation made Colbac nervous, and he attempted to head it off by saying, "Another pint of the Red, if you please."

"Yes, no denying it Colbac. D'ye remember when you went forth in search of adventure."


"When are you going to come to your senses and make an honest woman of me?" she teased back. It was

 He thought about dragging the lad down to the Temple so a healer could take a look at him. 


into the middle of the street. Someone would drag him off to the Temple soon enough. And who knew, perhaps another pretty Priest or Priestess would take an interest (or pity) in him. 


As Colbac waddled back into his store with all the grace of a hermit crab claiming a new home. He turned in the door way and then glared out into the early evening, as if daring any other adventurer to darken his doorway. From across the dirt road he heard laughter from the inn. His face twisted into a scowl as he thought of them in there. The boastful and the proud. The pretty and the brave. The one's who thought they were heroes in the making, but would all, sooner or later, wind up in Colbac's shop, broken and broke, asking for money. 

Please sir, they would all say, just a little bit more for this amulet, can't yous see the magic in it. I just need a little more to pay a healer to deal with this salamander bite. 

Colbac slammed the door as hard as he could. The panes of glass in his shop window rattled perilously but they held. 

He rubbed his leg again. These were the last days of summer and already he could feel the Winter's storms approaching in his hip. He settled back onto his stool and had a sip of beer. 

For a while, he stared at the door, as if daring the world to send another customer. But then his gaze wandered around his shop. To Colbac, of course, it was nothing special. It was his home and his store room all rolled into one. But for those broke and struggling adventurers across the street, Colbac's shop seemed a treasure trove. 
Here were enchanted Mage Robes that were stronger than steel. Heavy plate armor that not even a dragon's breath could melt. There were weapons of every imaginable size and quality. But the finest (displayed in the magically sealed case behind the counter)


---

"Hullo!" said a rather dull-faced peasant boy who looked like he had been raised on a diet of oats and hard work. Innocence and honesty  did not make sense to Colbac, so he distrusted him immediately. 


---

Colbac was a shop keeper, but in a special kind of shop. You, of course, are accustomed to shops where the owner or the employees are eager to see you, willing to help and unfailingly polite. The maxim, "The Customer is Always Right" is never far from the modern storeclerk's mind. But Colbac had no employees. And his clientle was very, very different. 

If Colbac had gone in for slogans or clever sayings, if even the first business book had been made available to him, he would have had one phrase knitted on a sampler and hung on the wall next to the club that he kept in case of "customers" that wanted to "haggle" just a little too hard. 

In courtly cross-stitch it would have said, "The Customer is always trying to screw you, Colbac." Every time he had forgotten this maxim, he had lost money. And once, he had lost part of an ear and all the gold he had in his strongbox. Which, in a full accounting of things, wasn't all that much. Business was never that brisk, and Colbac had never been all that handsome of a man. At times he thought the loss of the ear might have actually improved his appearance. 

Although it had been many, many years since an Ogre had been seen in the Kingdom, Colbac would do in a pinch. In fact, as a schoolboy, the other children, in the cruel thoughtless way of young children, who imagine that they are invincible and no injury can last more than an afternoon, taunted him that he  had teased him that his mother had be

To look at Colbac you would, in your heart, no matter how hard you tried, give some credence to the vile slurs of schoolchildren. To being with, he was lame, nearly bald, stout of chest and round of belly and one eye was larger than another. If you did not have to make a deal with him you could have been fooled into thinking he was dull-witted. But, as a person engaged in commerce, this belief would cost you. 

You see, Colbac was not flee of foot, keen of eye or strong of thew. He had never won a fight

And, in a time when it was not unheard of for peasants to be conscripted just so they could be melted down into rendered fat for the cauldron's of hot oil that were dumped onto those besieging the castle, Colbac was deemed unfit for service. 

Where the was a need for pain and iron, Colbac was there. If you needed a thing, somehow Colbac knew a guy. And for a price, he could get it for you. The world was small enough, the professions were few enough and the cocktail parties rare enough that no one ever asked Colbac, "So, what do you do?" But if they had, he would have shown himself to be one of the few rare men who could  answer, "What do you need done?" and mean it. 


He had started small, with little more than a few rags he found on the corpse of a dead adventurer. These 


Adventurer's had been, as far back as anyone could remember, quite common. There were no shortages of ruins, dungeons and fallen cities in the Kingdom of Gygax, and each one was rumored to have it's great treasure, powerful artifact or beautiful princess in need of rescue.





Most of the other boys he had gone to school with were dead now. There had been, of course, the war with Thrace and the

Thief brings in a gem -- which is a message in a bottle.
She is trying to find him. 

Thief tries to kill him and take his stuff when he goes into the dungeon. 

He takes cursed stuff into the dungeon. Gives a cursed sword to somebody who wants to kill him. The guy is over encumbered and collapses to the ground. Colbac then takes his stuff and leaves him there crushed to the ground. -- at the end of the story he's still crushed to the ground. 


---


He gets the message and what? How much do you need to play up the beginning. 

He knows some regular customers, sure. They all come back in the story -- let's say three of them. 


Nattick -- thief -- brings jewel.

Blastum -- world's worst mage. 

Aurelius -- a real fighter?  

---

[you need to describe this guy]

Picks the gem up with a protective gauntlet -- you can never be too careful. He'd seen what cursed items could do to the unwary. All too well he remembered a man who came in with +4 gauntlets of self-abuse. Oh, sure, he had tried to pass them off as ordinary steel gauntlets. "Just try them on" he said -- but Colbac could see the dark circles under his eyes and read the strain on his face. He knew something was up. 

So he just kept him talking until the terrible nature of the gauntlets revealed themselves. And when they did, the man broke down crying and begged Colbac to help him. Colbact calmly asked if the man had anything to sell that wasn't of negative value. 

When the man said no, Colbac apologized and said he couldn't help him. He wasn't in the charity business. 

As they had this conversation, the metal gauntlets were pawing at the man's crotch. As he explained, with some embarrassment, any moment tha the wasn't actively using his hands, the gauntlets were having his way with him. He allowed that for some, say young boys in the first grasp of puberty, this might be seen as a positive enchantment. But the thing was, they never stopped. And they never let him sleep. 

He knew they were cursed because he could not take them off -- or unequip them as he said. 

Five days he had been trapped in these gauntlets. And he feared if he could not get them off that he would go insane.

Colbac face turned to stone, matchign the stone of his heart when he said, "I cannot help you."

Colbac thought of it now and was glad of every penny he had spent on magic nullifying gloves and curse detecting wands. He had never understood the logic or sanity of magic. How much better off the world of commerce would be without all of it. How much more regular and sane. Ah well, it was here, he thought and so he would arbitrage it as best he could. 

He placed the wand on it's hanger behind the counter. The he stripped off the gloves and placed them in the workbench drawer on the far side of the room. Only then did he return to the gem which remained sitting, defenseless as it were, on his appraisal counter. 

Colbac yawned as he straightened and tidyed his shop. There was little enough to look forward to. Mostly just a good night's sleep between now and tomorrow's work. Perhaps he could stomach the foolish adventurer's at the Tavern long enough to squeeze in a pint and a glance at Lorna's tits. 


It was gem, like any other gem and then it wasn't. He sneered as he watched Nattick go. Wishing, in his blacken'd shopkeepers heart that the door would hit him on the way out. But then he took his magic protective gauntlet off his hand

---

Once upon a time there was shop keeper named Colbac. 

Everyday he bought low and sold high and was generally a miserable heartless bastard who hated everyone and thought that people who went into dungeons were stupid. 

Until one day, a thief came along with a seemingly ordinary jewel. But when Colbac touched it, it turned out to be a telepathic appeal from the long-lost love of his life. The one who had left him so long ago. She reveals that she is trapped in the bottom of the Dungeon of the Crazed Overlord and begs Colbac to rescue her. She knows that she has done him wrong, but she also knows that the Overlord mows down strong men like so many blades of grass and that strength will not save her. She needs cunning and tenacity. And Colbac is the most cunning, ruthless and tenacious man she has ever known. 

Because of this Colbac gathers the creme of his goods (a lifetime of them) and heads into the dungeon.

He runs afoul of Nattick who (true to suspicions, tries to kill him as he goes into the dungeon.)

He meets a very tough enemy who doesn't want to bargain (first sub-boss) Let's him take the sword of encumbrance. 

After that word gets around -- he starts saying, take whatever you like. 

(maybe he goes and gets the gauntlets of self-abuse -- Ouch)

Creeping coins. 
Sword of encumberance.

"Yeah, well some day, I'm gonna be my own king. I'm going to get to the bottom of a that damn dungeon. Get that Amulet and then I'm gonna be the most powerful man in the kingom. Marry the princess, become the king!"

"After waiting a respectable amount of time for the current king to pass of natural causes, of course," Colbac said with a wink.

"Well, some causes are more natural than others, if you know what I mean," said Blastum the Almost-Mage.

"Treason! Sedition! Guards!"

And with that the  stone-faced guards came to life and seized the Mage. The young lad screamed and kicked and generally pitched a fit. His spells of little fire danced harmlessly along their chain mail, barely warming the skin. 

"Here, enough of that!" said one of the guards as he slammed a fist into his annoying prisoner. 

As Baltac watched the guards drag him from his shop, Blastum's face, contorted in pain, seemed to say "Maybe I should have been a healer."

When the door had closed, Colbac picked up the multi-faceted jewel and placed it in the display case. Yes, that would fetch a pretty penny. And now he would surely be able to sell it well above his cost. There were many negotiation strategies, and Colbac knew them all.

To his credit, he felt no pangs of remorse at having cause a relatively innocent man to be thrown in the King's Dark Dungeon. If he truly was the greatest Wizard of the Age, he would escape and if not, then it would be better for him to rot in the King's Dungeon than to get torn apart by some horrible monster.  

Besides, the only dangers in the world weren't in dungeons and it was high time the lad learned that.

## Tavern Encounter.  



As he sat, pulling on his ale. 

"And I will be the one to defeat he great Oddna, for on my way here, a wise village elder foretold me that I was the chosen one, destined to life a great evil from this land."

"But, but, but," said the young man in Mage Robes.

"Yes, only by my hand can the Wizard be slain, for I am," here he stood and finished with a flourish, "The Chosen One. Isn't that right Rattick" The Rogue did not look up from sharpening his knife to say, "Yes, that's right. Very true, I was there and heard the whole thing. "

[she returns and gives him the favor -- as the fight breaks out, he covers his tankard of ale and leaves.]

As he gets to his shop, she thows them both out on their ear. Chosen one not strong enough to get defeat an Innkeeper -- what was the world coming to these days

Then Rattick, the thief comes into the shop. Just when he is going to have his ale in peace. 

Sipping his ale, surveying his wares. Loving his goods and lamenting that there are so few buyers. Oh in the days gone buy

But now just some seedy adventurer selling rope. 

"I have," said Rattick, "a magic item of great power, that I could be persuaded to sell you. But understand, I feel I am making a mistake parting with it. It's just," his smile looked like a wound that had become infected with teeth, "I have a sister in Blovatia, and she's terribly, terribly ill."

"Yes. I understand how hard that can be," said Colbac, "Having your only Sister taken hostage."

"Hmmm," he lied, "and with the illness and the strain of confinement I need money for the journey and for medicines and, of course for ransom. So loathe as I am to part with it, I must."

"It is a sad tale of woe you tell, brave adventurer," said Colbac, laying it on as thick has he could, "I am just happy that, humble merchant that I am, I have the means to purchase such a magnificent item, paying, of course, more than it is worth, because your sad tale of woe has moved me -- turned my heart of stone into flesh once more."

"Yeah," said Rattick, not quite comfortable with Colbac's sudden enthusiasm.

"So, shall I shower you in gold now, or can I see the item first?"

"Oh, right. Or course. I keeps it wrapped away for safekeeping."

"I'm sure you do."

Rattick reached into his pants, underneath his tremendous codpiece and retrieved a wad of dirty rags.

"Yes, I can see the value straight away," said Colbac. "My nostrils fairly burn with it.""

"Look you," snapped Rattick, no longer comfortable with being out bullshitted, "I come here in the interest of serious commerce. And you mock me."

It was all that Colbac could do not to continue the farce. He strained to make, "No, no, please. I am serious. Show me the item."

Rattick set the ball of rags on the counter and began to unwrap it with great caution. As layer after layer was peeled, back, Rattick became even more careful, to the point where he removed the last covering with his sizeable and much-sharpened dagger.  

This was Colbac's first clue that the item was magic, and quite probably cursed. For reasons more primal than profit (survival being the only thing that Colbac put above profit) Colbac was an expert on magical items. Or more correctly, he was an expert on Wizards.

Wizards, you see ran to themes. 

Gauntlets of self-abuse

<!-- Insert wizard bits. -->

"Well, what do you think?" Rattick demanded. Colbac said nothing. He backed away from what appeared to be a fist-sized ruby slowly, never taking his eyes off it. With one hand behind his back he opened the cabinet that held his most prized possession -- his gloves. 

The popular name for them were Gauntlets of Negation, but the name was inaccurate. The Gauntlets did not negate magic, put rather, were perfectly magic neutral. Like a lightning rod conducts magic away from a house, these gloves conducted magical energy away from the use. They remained totally neutral to the effect of any spell, charm, hex or incantation. 

For all there rarity and power (some even thought them not to exist) they looked like a gigantic pair of wool mittens. The kind that looked like they should be connected by a long strand of yarn to prevent them being lost or separated by an absent-minded or irresponsible child. 

As Colbac donned his gloves, Rattick eyed them greedily. They were easily worth several hundred times more than the jewel on the counter. Colbac could see the thought floating in the thief's eyeballs -- *if only I could steal them*. Colbac thought little of it. After all that's the exact kind of thought that should drift through a good thief's mind. But there was something else about his glance. Something that bothered Colbac.

"So, where'd you get this magnificent jewel then?"

"Oh, I, uh, that is to say, I prized it from the deepest depths of the Lair of the Mad Wizard, Oddna."

"You?"

"Yes, a brilliant bit of thievery, if I do say so myself."

Colbac's hand stopped inches above the jewel. The whole scene could have easily taken on an air of the absurd, if not for the obvious fear that both men had for the object on the counter. "You, yourself then?"

"Yes, the pride and prince of thieves I am."

"Oh, I can well see that," Colbac said with smile that got no farther than his lips. "But here's the thing. If I was a thief..."

"Oh, don't sell yourself short Gov, you should hear the things that are said about you around town."

"... if I was a thief, instead of just a man with a deep and abiding love for negotiation, I wouldn't waste my time or energy frittering around in some dungeon. I'd find myself a nice seat at the dungeon's entrance."

"You would," said Rattick, playing along as if every one of Boltac's words were cast from the purest fascination. 

"Then'd I'd sit there until the last survivor of a party of adventurers came along. Battered, bedraggled, probably half-dead --"

"Or three quarters dead, if you really want to save yourself the effort," Rattick offered.

Botlac nodded acknowledgment and continued, "Then'd I slip a knife in his kidney and go through his pockets for loose change and valuable magical items."

"You've got quite an active imagination there, Gov," said Rattick, looking more afraid than guilty.

"I'm sorry, did you say active or accurate."

"I said, active."

"Well," said Boltac, with a shark's smile, "It makes no difference to me, you see. I'm just a man who acquires useful and resalable items for the benefit of my customers."

"Yes, I can see that," Rattick said with great relief.

"So, tell me, this unfortunate man who bequeathed you this jewel with his dying breath."

"Ohhh, I like that one better. And it sounds so good when you tell it."

"What he in his right mind."

"Yes, yes, right and generous he was."

"Was he, perchance, muttering anything. Acting strange in any way."

"Come to think of it," Rattick said with a sheepish grin, "He was going on about some beautiful girl. And how he had to save her."

"Ah, I thought as much," said Colbac. "I will give you a gold piece for your accursed gem."

"Accursed gem. Why Gov. you wound me. You really, really do. Do you think I would pass off accursed merchandize to a man of your standing."

"Only if you thought you could get away with it."

"I cannot take so little. That's highway robbery, that's what that is."

"Yes, and you would know. If a gold piece isn't enough"

"5 gold." 

Then just collect your stone and go. Rattick's hand moved forward, then he checked himself. He knew what it was and he was loathe to touch it. One brush of a man's skin and the mindstone would posesses his thoughts utterly. Inserting desires and thoughts into it as one might inject poison into a sausage. 

No man would want such a fate. Even Colbac was wary of it ( as he was wary of all magical items. ) How much happier he would be if there were no magical items left in the world.





It was a mindstone. Anyone could see that.

## The Geography and Economy of Robrecht


But however you choose pronounce it, Robrecht had been a delightful place to be a shopkeeper. It was a bit ambitious to call Robrecht a kingdom, or if it was, it was the smallest kingdom on the continent, perhaps in the world. 

If all of Robrecht were flat, it could be crossed by a strong-legged person in a two days. Some twenty to thirty miles square. Although, the true shape of the kingdom has changed with countless wars, invasions, treaties, marriages, births, deaths and pig raids throughout the years.

It's fertile central valley is surrounded on all sides by mountains of daunting height. So it is that Robrecht is supplied with water, fertile growing land and, by virtue of it's position in the world, a steady stream of trade. It is a curious fact that Robrecht has arisen not because of one mountain pass, but four. 

So it is, the crossroads of the continent of Combari and a fantastic place to be an innkeeper or a merchant. Or so it had been.

Because, unfortunately, the 

Colbac had paid a pretty penny to the King (more a of a duke really) to receive a royal warrant to open a store. While tinkers and shyster of all stripe and profession. Could trade from rolls spread out alongside the road, Colbac was the only merchant legally allowed to engage in commerce in the entire small, yet lovely kingdom. 

When he had first received his permission and opened his store, business had been wonderful. The high passes that connected Robrecht to the rest of the world meant that, for all but the worst winter months, a steady flow of traffic. It was something of geographic magic -- Robrecht itself was the middle of nowhere, but it was somehow on the way to everywhere. As a crossroads it flourished. 

There were the haulers and the drovers and the merchant caravans, but there was also the carriage trade. A few continental nobles followed by endless trains of retainers, baggage, equipage and hanger-ons. 

And when they would stop in Robrecht to visit the King/Duke, they would realize their lack of thread, or fabric or leatherworking tools, travelling cases, fine silverware, ladies daggers (for protection only) or any one of the many, many specialty items that Colbac took great pains to stock. 

For several years, Colbac's managed to put the past behind him and turn a tidy profit. He bought a fine house on the town's finest hill and established himself. 

Of course, there were so few merchants in those days, that no one quite knew how to treat Colbac. Surely he did not deserve the honors accorded to a knight, but he was something more than the serfs who worked the fertile plain. So there he was, invited to some events, banned from others, given a good seat at the temple, listened to by all men. 

Yet the rich, scheming dowagers did not see fit to try to marry of their heavily dowried and heavily fatted, cow-eyed, sampler sewing daughters to him. As a man with a broken heart this suited Colbac. 

And because no one knew exactly how to treat him, this suited Colbac right down to the ground. 

But the salad days never stay green for long. And the things that made Robrecht a perfect trading outpost and a well-defended kingdom from the outside -- it's mountains, it's abundance of mining wealth, the river and fertile plain. It's large glaciated lake -- it's tiny secluded valleys --  also made it attractive to another kind of 

Wizards. And Dragons and all of the awful creatures of the earth. 

What Colbac did not know, and perhaps could not know when he purchased his liscense to trade from the Duke/King was that the whole thing had been a raw deal from the word go. That the Duke/Kind had seen the writing on the wall from the very start. And now, in this relative calm, was looting the treasury, sucking up all he could and within a year would abandon his title and disappear to live in luxury in one of the warm, decadent cities of the far south. 

within the year, the 



If demography is destiny, then surely geography is something more. Something deeper and more primal. Geography is prophecy. Geography is a kind of gravity. The shape of place is a promise. Show me a natural, deep-water harbor and sooner or later, you will have a town. Oh, you can't say when this will happen. And you can't say that the inhabitants of the town will be tall and fair, and use sails to harness the power of the wind as the circle the watery globe as honest traders. Nor can you predict that they will we strong and swarthy, tattooed
