# The Tavern, After



"That night, as we sat in the Inn, I told Boltac what I had heard."

"I don't like it," said Boltac. "Bad for business."

"Because a war is coming?"


Asarah, "You men with your fearsome imaginings. If I had a coin for every time I'd heard some man, deep in his cups, prophesy the end of the world in this common room -- fsheee -- I'd be a rich woman."

"But you do..." said Boltac.

Asarah cut him a look that would have melted through armor, had Boltac been foolish enough to think that armor would protect him from a beautiful woman. 

"At least, you should. Your patrons pay for their tankards of watered-down mead, do they not?" Boltac said, peering skeptically into his drink. 

"Aye, all of them but you."

"Well, there you go, all those coins, you're a rich woman. And one who his kind to her loyal customers." He said, raising his drink as if it was the finest example of the brewers art. 

"Well, then, the fact that I'm not should give you an idea of my overhead. To say nothing of the mental anguish comes from dealing with you lot. Would you like to try to weasel out of paying for another one there?"

Boltac smiled, "What can I say, I feel that I am a lucky man." 

Asarah scooped up the empty flagon and Boltac watched her go. "She's a beautiful woman, that one. But I wonder about her accounting."

"Rule Number One," I said. Boltac stopped me with an upraised hand.

"Don't RUIN it! Can't you see I'm having a moment here?" I shrugged and tucked into my supper. After a few bites, I realized the disturbing nature of what we had been discussing was unsettling my stomach.
