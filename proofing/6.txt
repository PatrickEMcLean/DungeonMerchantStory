, for Boltac's purposes, there was something in here more valuable than money. 

"Ah HA!" as said he held up a burlap sack. The sack looked like its only purpose in life was to hold twenty pounds of potatoes. "There you are," Boltac said to the sack as if was a precious child that he had found in a game of hide and seek. Of course, this was a ridiculous analogy -- Boltac hated children -- but this burlap sack? He couldn't have been more proud of the sack. 

He walked through his well-stocked store and placed items he might need for his journey into his sack. Into its modest opening he placed five goat skins of water, two of wine, 10 stout torches, a few flagons of the finest oil, three daggers, an axe, an ornate and well-jeweled, silver mace in a wooden case, a roll of rare tools used for the picking of locks and dismantling of doors and chests, several hundred feet of good rope, an extra pair of boots, two hats, several wool blankets, a lambswool sweater (the depths could be cold) a side of pork cured in salt, five pounds of hard biscuit and a pound of chocolate. 

But that wasn't all. He flitted here and there between the shelves, adding this and that and the other -- oddments and ointments -- anything Boltac thought he might need in the depths of some foul, unknowable place. Because, if there was one thing that Boltac knew about adventure, it was that you never knew, or could know, what was going to happen. 

The second-to-last thing to go in was the magic lantern of Lamptopolis. And very last of all, were his thick wool gloves of magic negation. Didn't want to be reaching around in a bag like that with bare hands that was for sure. 

Through all of this, the bag never bulged, or grew heavier than the 17 or 20 pounds that a sack that size, filled with potatoes, could be expected to weigh. The more Boltac had stuffed into the sack, the wider he had smiled. For an instant, he considered trying to fit EVERYTHING in to the sack, just to see if he could. But then he thought better of it. Even a magic sack had to have its limits. And if it didn't? That wasn't the kind of thing Boltac wanted to know. 

Boltac hated magic, but he loved this bag. It was Themistres Bag of Holding. One of only a very few known to exist. It was said that it would contain anything the owner could place into it. It never got heavier or bigger. It was, in effect, a bottomless bag. 

Themistres, as the story went, made the bag for his wife. She was a large woman who liked to travel heavy. The Wizard had not made many of them, and no Wizard seemed to have been able to duplicate his feat. Wizards seldom married, and the ones who did, generally wound up turning their wives into something that wouldn't bother them. The Bag of Holding was generally believed to be a myth, a pleasant fiction of overloaded husbands and servants everywhere. But Boltac had found one. And what a wondrous thing it was. Priceless, really. 

With this thought of pricing, he remembered the coins he left out in the back. He took out his gloves and put them on. He removed the magic lantern from the sack. It did not light as he touched it. Then, he added some gold to the sack. As he did, Boltac wondered, what was the point of holding any in reserve? It wasn't like he expected to be coming back. And that's when Boltac realized -- told the truth of it to himself -- he probably wasn't going to make it out of this adventure alive. 

He stopped and stood up in the back room of his store. He had worked so hard to build this store into a thriving business. Now, standing among the money he had worked so hard to accumulate, all of it seemed worthless. The heavy weight of the mittens of magic negation dragged his hands towards the floor, and his shoulders stooped. For a moment, tears ran down his round, weathered face. He let out one sob. Then sniffed and bent back to the task at hand. 

He piled *all* the gold into the sack. Who knew, perhaps he could buy his way out of this trouble? That was what a shrewd merchant would do. 

When he picked up the lamp this time, even though he was still wearing the gloves, a faint light shone out from its depths. Boltac didn't notice. 

Boltac left his store and headed North, for points unknown and unknowable. Yes, it was stupid. But there was nothing else to do. In the end, he had no more choice than a single raindrop falling onto the smoldering remains of a burned building. But that didn't mean he didn't have any choices. It had been a mistake to try fight like a hero. Boltac could see that now. He wasn't a hero. He wasn't a King either. But he wasn't powerless. Rather than go off half-cocked, he could use the skills and tools he had. He could do a better job of outfitting himself. And he would be damned if he would be *walking* to his death.

# 14 -- A New Pair of Boots -- 1654

Relan was wearing a new pair of boots. In fact, this was his first ever pair of boots of any kind. Up until this point he had only worn sandals or wooden shoes. And these had been hand-me-downs. In one way or another, it seemed that everything in Relan's life had been a hand-me-down. That's the way it was when you were the youngest of seven on a cold-water farm hidden away in the fog-shrouded mountains of Robrecht. There was plenty of work and nothing else. 

But if they could see him now?

Over a linen tunic, he wore a shirt of shining chain mail. It wasn't the best mail that Boltac had, but it was the best-looking. Around his neck, a cloak made of hammered felt was clasped with a chain of silver. On his hip, the sword Boltac had given him swung from a wide leather sword belt. On his opposite hip was a dirk with its handle worked into the shape of a screaming eagle. Pants of the finest, softest deer skin he had ever encountered were tucked into the black boots with high cuffs and silver buckles. This is how a hero should look, he thought. 

Oh, they had laughed at him on the farm -- well, his older brothers and sisters had, Ma and Pa had been too tired. They took the news of his departure as they took all news, good or bad, with the tired stare of someone who has seen the worst that the seasons and the ways of man have had to offer. From long habit, they tried not to get excited one way or another. 

"You'll be back," his eldest brother had said, in imitation of the  hard, bitter speech of his father. But then his stern face softened, and he added, "And you'll be welcome. If you conquer the world, littlest brother, be sure to save us a piece." A last smile and a wink and Relan had been on his way. He knew that none of his family ever expected to see him again. One way or another, when someone left the high valley, they never seemed to come back. 

But if they could see him now! Mail glinting in the sunlight, hair blowing in the wind and the heels of these magnificent boots ringing off the cobbles. Announcing to all the world that he who walked in these boots was not a man to be trifled with. 

Yes, he would go back. Just as soon as he was finished, he would go back home and show them. All of them. His sullen family, the joyless villagers. He would come back like something out of the sagas that the strange wandering minstrels sang of in a vain attempt to cheer the flat, simple people of the land. But he would wait until he had something more than a new suit of clothes to show for his adventures. 

The farther Relan walked through the city, the more troubled his mood became. Everywhere he looked, he saw the signs of the last night's carnage. Blood spilled on the cobblestones, bodies lying in the streets. Loved ones gathering corpses. Families fleeing for the gates with possessions hastily piled in wagons. And fear on every face. 

His music of his strides against the stones took on a sour note. He wondered if he should have done more last night? But the memory of what he had done, the creature and the killing of it, send a shiver of fear up his spine. He hadn't had time to think. Hadn't had time to be afraid. But now that he had time, he was afraid, and worse. He was honest enough with himself to remember shaking afterwards. And the thought of going out into the night again, to face more of those snarling, tusked creatures on wolves -- it turned his blood to water once again. 

He should have done more to help. A real hero would have fought all night. Would have fought until the enemy was driven from the city. But Relan had not. Why? 

Perhaps because it wasn't his city? At least not yet. He had only been in Robrecht a week. And it hadn't been a pleasant week. Sleeping in a makeshift tent in a muddy ditch underneath the shadow of the south wall had been rugged enough. But the people were worse. Unfriendly, mean, shrewd, hard-dealers one and all. None had the time to make a penniless farm boy feel welcome. For all the wonderful things he had heard about the cities, he couldn't understand why everyone was so excited about them. 

He had almost given up. Then he had had met Sabrellia. She had appeared to him in the muck and the mire of Robrecht's agricultural market. Relan was on the verge of giving up. He had come to the farmer's stalls to look for work. He was a strong lad and knew how to work hard. But as he stood there, hungry, exhausted, covered in filth, somehow he couldn't bring himself to speak the words. 

It would mean defeat. It would mean giving up and eventually going back to the farm in the tiny valley. It would mean that his brothers and sisters were right to laugh. And, worst of all, it would mean that the best he could hope to get from life would be that same, hard, beaten look that was the battered inheritance his parents have saved up for him. 

"You seem troubled," a voice said. 

Relan turned and gasped. "What are you?" He was taken aback by the vision of fully perfumed breasts, full, lovely and contoured under sacred robes. 

"I am a priestess, a loyal handmaiden of the Temple of Dar, but how could you not know that?"

"I, uh, am... uh..."

"You are a traveller!" she exclaimed, saving him from his awkward stammering. "A wanderer, a seeker of adventure!"

"Yes," he said, because he would have said yes to anything this perfumed, breathless woman said. She smiled, and Relan felt himself go a weak in the knees. There was a gap between her front teeth that her tongue darted into and away from. She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. 

"Dar commands us to serve all travelers and seekers," she said. "Tell me your name."

"Uh, Relan...?" he said, still bewildered.

"Well is it or isn't it?"

"What?"

She laughed brightly, in a way that was as far from mocking as the bright sunshine is from the rain. "Very well, Relan. I am Sabriella. I am pleased to meet you," she said with a curtsey. Then she slipped her hands around his arm and guided him from the marketplace. 

"My, you are very strong," she exclaimed, accidentally telling the truth. 

She guided him along Robrecht's streets until they were walking beside the nicest part of the river. The great keep loomed off to their right and almost managed, in the afternoon light, to look regal. Sabriella talked with him gently and gave him the gift of listening well and laughing often at his awkward stories. In no time at all, Relan was completely at ease with the radiant creature on his arm. 

"Oh, but you must be famished!" she said and dragged him into a small pot shop. The owner greeted her warmly, and they were soon seated. To her great delight he had three bowls of stew. Best of all, the owner wouldn't take payment. Which was good, because Relan was completely broke. 

They went back out in the street and walked for a time that felt to Relan like both and instant and an eternity. The sun cast longer and longer shadows through the narrow streets and alleys, until finally they heard the tolling of the temple bell. 

"But I must return," Sabrellia exclaimed, "I had not noticed the hours passing so quickly in you presence. I have only been granted parole for the day, and the streets are not safe for such as I after dark."

"I will walk you to the temple and keep you safe," Relan said with all the sincerity there was in the world. 

"You must not! I cannot be seen with you. And you cannot be seen with me. I know to one so experienced in *adventure* the hardship of a dungeon, and the Temple's Questioner means nothing, but I am a much frailer creature."

"But, I don't think,"

She placed a finger on his lips. "You are so strong, so handsome, so brave... The temple cares not for one so humble as I... but I know that if  I were in trouble -- in danger I mean -- that you would come for me. That you would save me. Just like a hero. My hero."

He nodded like the idiot he was. And was going to follow her anyway, but then she paralyzed him with a kiss. 

Of course, he had been kissed before. But the simple, sullen, load-bearing creatures of his village hardly seemed the same species as the delightful girl that pressed her painted lips to his. Such a kiss! He felt his feet break into a sweat. He closed his eyes and saw colors that he never imagined existed. It was the kind of kiss that would make a more experienced man ask some pretty hard questions about the purity of the Virgin Priestesses of Dar. 

"Promise me you will meet me here tomorrow. Dar has inflamed me with love for you, and you cannot deny the Goddess her divine purpose. Say it! Say you will meet me."

He swallowed hard and said, "I will."

And then she ran off around the corner. Her sandaled feet slapped the cobblestones as Relan caught flashes of her milk white thighs from beneath her flapping robe. 

When she was out of sight, he rubbed his lips and smiled to himself. This was the start of it then. The grand adventure of his life that he left the village to find. 

Then the screaming started. 


# 15 -- The Need of a Sword -- 624

Relan rounded the corner so fast that he lost his footing and slipped on the cobbles. With the strength that came from long days of hard work on the farm, he caught himself on his palm and shoved the upper half of his body back on to balance.

He saw two men in black running away with Sabriella, one holding her over his shoulder, the other glaring back at him and brandishing a wickedly curved knife. He was pretty sure *they* weren't priests of the infinitely kind and forgiving, Dar, the first Goddess of Mercy

On the street in front of him, a third man lay on the cobbles.  He lifted a hand weakly and called after the kidnappers. "Please! Don't hurt her," he sobbed. Sobbed, thought Relan? What weak, unmanly, unheroic behavior was this? Had this man not heard the sagas? The full-throated minstrels singing of heroes rescuing beautiful ladies in distress through acts of physical valor? This was not how it was done. 

Clearly, this man would be no help. Relan dashed passed him and turned the corner. In front of him was a long alley. Sabriella was nowhere to be seen. What sorcery was this? Relan ran faster, trusting that if the hero was pure of heart, he would prevail in the end. 

In defense of this naivete, Relan had spend many of his formative years listening to wandering minstrels trying to coax a meal out of flint-hearted farmers with song at the village longhouse. He knew them all by heart. And in not a single one of them had the hero ever stopped to check the doors he ran past. 

Relan ran on and on, running out of patience before he ran out of breath. He trotted to a halt and spun around, glaring at the blameless buildings of old Robrecht town as if they had personally wronged him. But, in the end, he was left with the ugly fact -- they had gotten away with love of his young life.

Cursing his luck and the perfidious sorcery with which Sabriella had been snatched away from him, he returned to where he had lost her. The wretched man was still sobbing in the middle of the street. 

When he heard Relan's sandals, the man looked up and said, "She is my sister. Oh, cruel gods, it is all my fault." He dropped his head, and his long, stringy hair fell across his face. Sobs shook his shoulders. 

Relan picked the man up and set him on his feet. The wretch weighed almost nothing. "Who?" he asked. "Where?" 

"It's all my fault," he repeated. His large dark eyes seemed like haunted pits sunk into his pale skin. "The dice. I lost too much money at dice. And they have come for her."

Relan said, "I can rescue her!"

"You? You have money?"

"No. I have no money, but I have courage."

"Courage?" he said, as he looked off into a hopeless middle distance. "They won't take courage. I owe them money. Do you have money? Can you get money? I meant to get money at dice. But..." and here the pitiful sobbing took over once again. 

"I can rescue her! If you would but tell me where they have taken her."

"No, they would kill her before they would let you have her. No, money is the only way. It is the only way to do anything in this world." The man with hopeless eyes said.

"Look at me. Look at me!" Relan commanded. "I will return your sister to you. This I vow. Now tell me, where they have taken her?"

"You?" said the man with a laugh bereft of hope, "You don't even have a sword."

The man's pitiful wails seemed to follow Relan through the streets as he went in search of a sword.


# 16 -- Relan Learns a Lesson -- 1393

Of course, a sword was hard to find. Relan had tried to beg or borrow one for two days before he worked up the nerve to go and talk to Boltac. He had gone to the market, looking for work as a laborer. He had begged for change from rich passerbys. But nothing had worked. Sabriella's brother, a poor wretch named Stavro, lived in a shack built against the outside of the Southron wall. Every time he saw Relan he had wailed and cried. He told and retold his sad tale, claiming that it was all his fault, but he would not *do* anything about it. He lacked the courage, he said. He lacked the strength, he said. All he had was love for his sister and hatred for himself. 

He was worthless, except for the information that Relan had managed to extract from him. The men who had taken Sabriella worked for a man named Hogarth, a thug who controlled gambling in Robrecht. They had taken her to a hold in the South, a pile of dark stones on the River Swift known as the Tower of Forgetting. There they would keep her for a week. Then the rapes would start. The week after that, they would cut fingers off. Relan did not think to ask how this creature, Stavro, could describe such tortures in detail without breaking down into tears. 

Relan, of course, vowed that he would rescue his lady (with all faithfulness and heroism) but the how of it had been impossible until he had saved the Merchant Boltac. Now that he was armed, free and left to his own devices, the question became, what should he do? Robrecht needed to be avenged, and the threat of these Orcs and that evil flying wizard needed to be dealt with. Clearly, that was a selfless hero's first duty, wasn't it?

But, on the other hand, he had unfinished business. His lady had been kidnapped and wanted rescuing. He could think of no saga, song or lay in which the hero had left his lady in peril to embark on a larger, more important quest. But, in a moment of unusually clear thinking, it seemed that the needs of the city should come before the needs of one heartbroken hero. Shouldn't they?

So it was, lost deep in the shallows of his limited philosophy, that Relan bumped into a wheelbarrow with a corpse in it. He muttered half an apology before he recognized the man pushing the barrow. "Stavro! You have survived the assault. I am so glad." Relan heard a sharp intake of breath. A decidedly *feminine* intake of breath. He looked up to see a teary-eyed Sabriella on the other side of the wheelbarrow. 

"Sabriella, you have been rescued!"

"Why, I uh, yes, Relow! I, uh, have been..." she looked from side to side, unsure of what she should say in this situation. Relan's smile faded when he realized that the man standing behind her was none other than the man in black with the knife who had carried her away from him in the first place.

"My lady," Relan said, "I thank the Gods that you have been returned to me unharmed, but I am confused by..."

"Oh, I just bet you are," one of the men in black quipped. 

"Silence, varlet or I will stave in your head," Relan said, because it seemed like the kind of thing a hero should say in this situation. 

"Let's steal his boots!" said the man in
