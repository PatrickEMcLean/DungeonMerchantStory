came with them. In comparison to these Orcs, Samga was more refined. It was as if he were a slightly different animal all together. Recognizable as part of the same genus, but not the same species. The ones guarding the door were more animal. They snorted and scuffled their claws against the tile. They paid careful attention to Asarah. And one of them, who stared at her with unblinking, hollow, black eyes, drooled a little. 

Dimsbury waved a hand, and his creatures were silenced. 

"So," he said to Boltac, "What brings such and unlikely and unprepared hero to the depths of my lair?"

"Hero?" said Boltac, trying not to let the fear show. "I ain't no hero. You want the other guy." He jerked a thumb at Relan, who was struggling not to cut his throat against the pressure of Rattick's blade by breathing too deeply.

"Be whatever you like. The question remains, why are you here? Why are you disturbing me?"

Boltac could see no percentage in lying. He jerked his other thumb at Asarah and said, "Her."

"Oh really, is it true love?" asked Dimsbury in a mocking tone. He rubbed his hands together with great relish. When Asarah and Boltac both blushed, he laughed. "Oh my, it *is* true love. And I thought it was rarer than unicorns. But wait, no it can't be true love, because you told me you had no interest in her. And I took you to be the sophisticated man of commerce you represented yourself as."

"I said she wasn't my wife. And that doesn't give you license to steal her."

"I don't care for being stolen," said Asarah 

"Yes, you are right. I have stolen her, fair and square, and she is mine. And you have come to fight for her. Fine. Take your pick of my creatures you see here before you. You may fight any one of them for her hand. Then, if you win, you may fight the rest of them. And then, if you defeat all of them, you may do battle with me."

"No," began Boltac.

"No? What do you mean no? You have come here as an *adventurer* -- as the Hero -- to rescue the damsel in distress. You must fight. That's how these things are done."

"I'm not here for a fight. You stole her, fine. She is your property, but I thought perhaps we could make a deal."

"BUY ME!" protested Asarah, "is that your idea of chivalry? Buying the woman you love back from..."

"I never said anything about Chivalry," Boltac snapped. "You know how many men have tried to defeat the great Dimsbury? You know how many have succeeded?"

"None," said Dimsbury with a great swelling of pride. "I'm entirely too powerful to be defeated by anything but a mythical chosen one, a thing which I reasonably certain only exists in within the protected confines of sagas. And if such a one does exist, I'm certain he's not a short, grubby, lame merchant from the backwater town of Robrecht."

"Yes, yes, mighty Dimsbury -- you are a wise, powerful and handsome man," flattered Boltac. "A man of the world who is quick to perceive his own advantage and capitalize on it. So I offer you a lucrative trade."

Dimsbury's eyes narrowed, "A trade you say, tell me more..."

Boltac reached into his bag and withdrew a large coin purse that he showed to be overflowing with gold. "I offer 100 gold pieces for the girl."

"Girl?" Dimsbury snorted, "A handsome woman, certainly, but not a girl."

"The offer stands, a 100," he hefted the purse and reconsidered, "A hundred and two gold pieces, for Asarah."

"But I have such a love of her mutton sandwiches. Crisp and fatty and delicious." He shivered a little to emphasize the point. 

"I cannot compel one so powerful as you to do anything, but my offer presents you with a clear choice -- mutton sandwiches, or the gold."

"Oh that word. I cannot abide that word "or". So harsh on the pallet, so cruel to the ear. I do not accept ors."

Boltac nodded his head deeply in recognition. "I understand Great Wizard. I understand. But all life is trade-offs. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Surely you understand this. The money or the girl."

"No, I'll take the and."

"The And?" asked Boltac.

"The And?" asked Asarah

"Unh?" grunted one of the Orcs.

"The And," said Rattick with an approving nod. "That's what I'd take."

"Okay, so it's question of price," said Boltac.

"No, I don't think you understand," said Dimsbury with a little chuckle.

"Understand what? It's a negotiation. So, how much you want for her?"

"Boltac!" protested Asarah.

"The, uh, serving girl here," Boltac asked, giving her the signal to calm down with a downward wave of his hand behind his back. "I want my lady friend back. How much for your serving girl, my lady friend?"

"Well, *Merchant*, before we *bargain*, let me show you a few things, so that you might know what manner of man you bargain with."

"En-henh," said Boltac. Even though the Orcs did not speak English, they could hear the contempt in his voice. Several of them snarled. Dimsbury raised his hand.

"Samga, silence them or end them, I care not which."

"I hear and obey," said Samga. He whispered something in the crude, unfinished language of the Orcs. Whatever it was, the rabble blocking the door snapped to attention.

"Ah, dear Samga, with a thousand such men as you, I would still have a horde of Orcs. But a far, far better horde. At any rate, my dear Merchant, do you know what this is?" Dimsbury indicated the in-focus, out of focus flame that flickered on the dais next to him. 

"Eh," Boltac began intent on making some kind of crack that would take the wind out of Dimsbury's over-stuffed sails. But the Wizard would have none of it. 

"SILENCE! I will have none of your mockery and crude calculation!" With a nimbleness that Boltac did not expect from looking at him, the Wizard leapt up on the dais. He caressed the heavy glass vessel within which the flame danced. "This is beyond money. Beyond your crude buying and selling. This is the essence of the source, the headwaters of magic itself. See how it flickers imperfectly, blurred, too pure to be fully realized on this flawed plane of existence."

Boltac rolled his eyes.

"NO!" Thundered the Wizard. "This is not to be mocked. Not even slightly. This is power. POWER do you understand! With power you can get money. But no Merchant," he spat the title like a curse, "can ever buy power." 

"Have you ever put that to the test?" Boltac asked, with a scrappiness he was faking for the purposes of negotiation. Of course, the Wizard was right but Boltac would be damned if he'd give this twisted nobleman the satisfaction of telling him that. 

To Boltac's surprise, the Wizard laughed. "Very good. Skepticism. The basis of all knowledge. Are you a seeker too, friend Boltac? Then let me show you something." Dimsbury stepped down from the dais and crossed to a small door on the far side of the room. 

"Come, merchant! I will show you what I think of money." The Wizard gestured to a spot on the wall and the blank stone changed into a doorway. "Themistres Third Spell of Ward and Concealment. Do you know it? No matter." Dimsbury turned the knob and opened the door. "Go ahead, have a good look."

Rattick took the knife off Relan's neck and stepped forward so he could see

In the room beyond the door, there were chests and sacks overflowing with gold and jewels. Golden candelabras, salvers and goblets all encrusted by the jeweler's art until it was a wonder they could still stand up under their own weight. It was the most impressive treasure room Boltac had ever seen. 

The Merchant blew a long, low whistle, "That is a lot of jingle-jangle you got there."

"So you see, your offer of gold, for the girl... Here, may I?" Dimsbury reached for the purse of a hundred and two coins. Boltac handed it to him.

"Hmm, yes. Watch this." Dimsbury threw it at the feet of the Orcs. The purse broke open and gold coins scattered across the floor. Instantly the Orcs broke rank and fought for the gold pieces. Boltac jumped back. Rattick disappeared into the shadows. Only Samga remained standing, though he seemed to be under great strain. 

At first it seemed like simple greed, but when an Orc got a hold of a few coins, it thrust them between its tusks and gobbled them up greedily. The pecuniary gluttony went on until there were but a few coins left. Then the Orcs began to fight over them.

"Enough!" cried Dimsbury. He clapped his hands together and there was a sound like thunder. The Orcs froze. "You see, my orcs are hungry for gold. Not greedy, you understand, but literally *hungry* for gold. They eat it. A flaw in the design, I'm afraid. They require heavy minerals and metals of all sorts in vast quantities. It's the only thing they crave more than human flesh. I am afraid I have created an armory that marches on the treasury. Upkeep is murderous, but then, so are they. But, as you see, I have quite a lot of gold. And as they mine more for supper, your paltry hundred gold pieces are worth nothing to me. Merchant, you cannot negotiate. You have nothing I want."

"Wait, wait," Boltac said, opening his sack, "I've got more. I've got a lot of gold. I mean I don't even know how much it is. Not as much as in your magic room there, but it's a lot. A fortune. And this sack, it's a magic sack. A sack of holding. Themistres'. Take it. I mean, please, you're welcome to it."

"Really," said Dimsbury, "One of old Themistres' sacks. I met him once you know?"

"Yeah, so, it's a very nice sack. This sack and all the gold in it. And, in exchange, you give me that vile-tempered woman. You don't want to own her anyway. Believe me, the upkeep on her is *real* murder."

"No one owns me," Asarah snarled.

"See what I mean?" asked Boltac, "Who needs that? I'd be doing you a favor."

"You know," Dimsbury said with a strange half-smile, "I must admit, you are a civilized man."

Boltac made a little bow, "Thank you."

"Do you have any idea how many people have tried to raid my dungeon, laboratory, whatever, trying to steal my property?"

"I am not raiding you. I am a customer," he said taking pride in the title.

"Yes, here for trade. Trade is vile. But, I must admit, it is more civilized than treachery, deception and thievery."

"Deception has it's uses for the mighty," whispered Rattick from the corner of a round room. How did he do that?

"Yes, civilized…" Dimsbury said, staring off into the smoky air of his spherical chamber. "I have spent so much time arguing for unreasonable people to take the civilized path."

"It's always the best way," Boltac said hopefully, "Reasonable people, getting along in a reasonable world. Able to do business together? Reasonably?" he asked hopefully. 

"It is surprising," said Dimsbury.

"Funny old world, isn't it," said Boltac. 

"Seize him!" commanded Dimsbury. Samga snapped his fingers and three Orcs leapt from the rabble and grabbed Boltac. Samga barked, "Take him to the cells," in the harsh tongue of the Orcs. 

"No!" cried Asarah.

"Wait, wait!" cried Boltac. 

"And bring the bag to me," said Dimsbury.

"Believe me, Mr. Wizard, you don't want to mess around in that bag," said Boltac as the Orcs dragged him away.

"STOP!" cried Dimsbury. "What did you say?" he asked Boltac.

"I said, for your own good, you should leave that bag alone."

"WHAT!"

"Okay, this is just ridiculous. What are you a moron? I said, stay outta the bag, or you'll regret it."

"DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM!"

"Johnny Hubris?" asked Boltac, "He's a guy I usedta know. Nevermind."

Dimsbury clapped his hands together, and lightning bolts ricocheted around the stone chamber. Everything human in the room hid its face against the terrible noise and rush of superheated air. "I command the forces of nature. I can harness the elemental power that turns the world. And I am supposed to be afraid of your sack of goodies?"

"Only if you're not a jackass," Boltac said out of the side of his mouth. 

Dimsbury crooked his fingers into a claw. Boltac was ripped from the grip of the Orcs and lifted into the air. 

"Offering me a trade," Dimsbury sneered. "I have no need of your *trade*. I will take the AND. I will take your gold, AND I will take your sack AND I will take your woman AND I will take your life. Did I forget anything?" He waved his other hand, and the wooden cover at the center of the chamber crashed into the ceiling and shattered into toothpicks. Dimsbury turned and dangled Boltac over the bottomless pit.

As Dimsbury turned, he exposed his back to Relan. Strictly speaking, it wasn't the most heroic of opportunities, but Relan saw it and seized it. His legs drove him forward. He could almost feel the Wizard's neck in his hands. He could imagine what it would feel like to bash the man's skull against the ground. He made it one step, two steps, three steps. It was going to work! He raised his hands, then he felt the knife slide into his belly.

"No, no," said Rattick, still holding the lunge position that had brought him out of the shadows, "we'll have no heroes here."

Asarah stopped sobbing and struggled to breathe. 

Relan  managed staggered forward another step dragging Rattick with him. 

Asarah pleaded, "No. Don't crush him!"

"Oh, I say," Dimsbury said with a smile, "That *is* a good idea. That way it will hurt more on the way down. Goodbye Merchant." Dimsbury opened his hand.

Boltac dropped into the bottomless pit. 

# 34 --  Aftermath -- 563


Rattick slid knife through Relan's belly and pulled it out. The brave Farm Boy collapsed to the floor, trying to hold his guts in. 

Asarah screamed until her lungs were out of air. When she paused to take a breath, she could still hear the far off echoes of Boltac's body crashing into the sides of the pit. She screamed again, but with very little air in her lungs her degenerated into a cycle of shallow, choking sobs. 
 
"Hmm, yes, thank you Rattick, for taking care of that minor nuisance."

"I live to serve, my Lord."

"It would be nice to believe that, wouldn't it Rattick?"

"Well, whatever humble reward you could see fit to bestow on my unworthy person."

"Oh, Rattick. Oh, Faithful Rattick," he said his voice dripping with sarcasm, "Your job was to see that no adventurer's disturbed me."

"And for that, my cut was whatever loot they had on them," Rattick said, eying Boltac's magic sack greedily. 

"Yes, but you see, I have been well and truly distub-"

"Geh," said Relan, as the last of his life leaked out across the stone floor. 

"Oh, good Lord man, just die already and get it over with." Dimsbury looked at Asarah, collapsed in a heap on the ground. "You'll clean this up! I swear to the Nether Gods you will. They're your rescuers. This is your mess. Now, where was I? Oh yes, Rattick. I know not what to do with you."

"I just saved your life, Master."

"You saved my robe, Rattick. You think that he had a chance?"

"Eeeh," said Rattick.

Dimsbury bent over and addressed the dying boy directly, "You never had a chance! Do you understand? Not a chance."

Relan made a gurgling noise. 

"So, Rattick, I will allow you to take as much gold as you can gather and carry from Boltac's sack. Is that acceptable?"

"Quite acceptable."

"Excellent. And I trust I will never see you again."

"Not in this, or any other lifetime," Rattick said with a courtly bow of his head. 

"Very well, Samga, take the sack to the UnderHall, gather the horde and dump the Merchant's gold for the feast."

"As you command, Master."

"But," Rattick interrupted, as gently as possible, "I take mine first, right?"

"Oh, no Rattick, where is the sport in that? No, you can scrabble and claw for your reward with the rest of my creatures. Conduct him to the UnderHall and give him the place of honor," Dimsbury said with a smile. Rattick was quickly surrounded by Orcs and led from the room. 

As he left, he had just enough time to say, "You are too kind, Master."

Dimsbury dismissed them with an annoyed wave. 

"What shall I do about this one, Lord?" asked Samga, nodding at Relan.


"Leave him to die slowly. Kill him not. But when he is done, you may feed him to whatever Orcs you deem worthy of reward. Or keep him for yourself Samga. You deserve it for keeping this rabble in line."

"They will be so pleased Master," said Samga.

"I am a good and gentle master, am I not?" 

"The finest master," said Samga. 

"Now I am off to my chambers. I simply must rest. And the first creature to disturb me, will not remain a creature. Am I understood?"

Samga nodded. Dimsbury left. Samga remained for a moment, considering the horrible scene before him. Underneath Asarah's choking sobs, could hear the labored, gurgling breathing of the dying lad. He twitched his head once, then hurried off to his duties. 


# 35 -- The Bottom of a Bottom-less Pit -- 1033

Boltac awoke to more pain than he realized the world could hold. It was a universe of pain, a cosmos of pain, and he was at the center of it. In the darkness there was only pain. He tried to open his eyes and there was pain. He tried to close his half-opened eyes and there was pain. His body made the mistake of trying to cough. Then the darkness took him again. He didn't even have time to ask how it might be that he was still alive. 

An age, a time, or a moment later, he awoke again. There was a soft rustling in the darkness beside him, and he felt the touch of many creatures he could not see. It was not comforting. 

"Wha--" he tried to ask, but too many ribs were broken for him to speak. He wheezed in pain. The soft touches -- were they hands, or something else -- migrated to his side. Under their strange caresses, the pain eased. As he controlled his loud and labored breathing, he became aware of a low, whispered song all around him. It disappeared into the blackness with no echo, as if he were in a room so vast as to have no walls. 

After a time, the pain in his side was soothed. His breathing came easier. Unexpectedly, his body was wracked with sobs. In that place of dry darkness, tears streamed down his face and infinite softness blotted them away. "I should be dead," Boltac said at last.

"Someday, you will be," said the voice in the darkness. 

"Is this magic?"

"Magic? It is just flawed creatures caring for one of their kind. But there is a magic in that, yes."

The voice said nothing else. The silence made Boltac nervous, so he joked, "I guess this bottomless pit had a bottom after all."

"There is no such thing as a bottomless pit," said the voice in the darkness.

"No such thing as a free lunch either," said Boltac. "So, who are you and why are you helping me?"

"We are the fallen ones, the discarded ones. The ones that were made, but not unmade."

"En-henh," Boltac said, trying to sit up and immediately regretting it.

"Be still, for your kind was also once made. And, as broken as you are, are not beyond salvation, if you will allow it."

"Ho-oh boy. What is going on here? Am I dead? Did I have to pay for own my funeral?"

"We have been shaped and have learned something of the shaping of life. We are the forgotten ones. The made and discarded."

"Wait, wait, you are..."

"The Wizard's forgotten sons. The ones he made and thought to unmake, by discarding us in this place."

"So, uh, forgive me if this is a rude question, but why aren't ya dead? For that matter, how come I'm still here?"

"When he made us, he did not weave a full spell. He did not allow for the possibility of death. So we must go on for eternity."

"Wait? You mean you can't die?"

"A horse can die, for it is alive. But we are like the carriage. We are not alive, but we function. We cannot die. Only fall apart for all eternity. Unless..."

The singing stopped. 

"Unless what? What's the catch? There's always a catch," said Boltac.

"We have done all we can for you."

"And thanks for that. I don't feel good, but I don't feel dead either."

"No life should be discarded."

"You don't get around much do you?" Boltac asked the voice. "Who are you? Not the plural you, not youse, but you in particular."

"I am the UnderKing, first among the broken."

"Oh, sorry about that, your honor, my liege, whatever. I didn't realize your kind had nobles."

"We did not. But in the darkness, nobility is called forth by need."

"En-henh? Come again?"

"The flame, the one the Wizard worships."

"You mean the 'Source of All Magic'?"

"The very one. He is powerful, powerful beyond all those who have come before him."

"But there's a catch," said Boltac, "There's always a catch. No such thing as a free bottomless pit."

"If the link is severed, if the flame of magic is quenched, it will
