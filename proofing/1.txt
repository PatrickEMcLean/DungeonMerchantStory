# **The Merchant Adventurer** 


# 1 -- In the Company of Heroes -- 1517

"I am the chosen one. Only I can bring peace and restore balance to the land," said the blonde Knight in Shining™ Armor.

"You still don't understand," said the Ranger, clad-in-mail. He hiked up his sleeve and showed the mark that was burned into his arm. "This symbol of the Cruel God Azaz, signifies,"

"Azaz my Az-ass! that your whore of a mother spilled bacon fat on you when you were a child."

The men drew swords and faced off. But before either of them could swing, a thin man, dressed in faded black, stepped between them. He said, "Please my Lords, please, we mustn't fight among ourselves."

"Out of my way Rattick! You are but a hireling!" cried the Ranger, "It is my destiny to run him through."

"Your destiny? Don't be absurd. I am the CHOSEN ONE!" shrieked the Knight.

"Perhaps," said Rattick, "you have both been chosen." They stopped to consider this possibility. Rattick pressed on, "We go to face a mighty foe. A powerful wizard in a deep dungeon. Perhaps all the others have failed not because they didn't have *a* chosen one, but because they didn't have *enough* chosen ones."

"I AM THE CHOSEN ONE!" they both shouted.

Okay, thought Rattick, that was a mistake. Best to let the morons fight it out. But before he could step off the field of idiocy (or battle) the Enchantress chimed in. "Don't talk to him like that," she said, "He is a member of this party. Moreover, the sacred vows I have taken at the Shrine of Lauranda, means that I must treat all beings with courtesy and respect, and eat nothing that has a face," she intoned with reverence.

Surprisingly, this worked. The men lowered their swords and apologized (apologized!) to each other. Rattick stared longingly at the Enchantress. She was beautiful. Her curves were accentuated by the belt of gold rings that encircled her hips and the massive ruby that gleamed from between her breasts. Perhaps there was a way that he could... No. Better not to think of such things. 

"Forgive me good Rattick," said the Knight, his head bowed, "Though it is true that we have hired you to guide us to the lair of foul Wizard Dimsbury, you have served us true and are a member of this party."

"We brave companions," said the Ranger, "we happy few, each, in our own way, fulfilling a mystical and wondrous destiny. Yes, we are all sorry to have used you so badly faithful Rattick."

Rattick's jaw dropped. Could they be serious? Was it possible that they were they conning him rather than the other way around? He clacked his teeth together and pasted a smile across his sour mouth. "Not at all, good sirs," said Rattick. "We are adventurers! Spirits run high with ones so bold as we." 

"Huzzah!" cried the Knight, as he lifted his heavy blade in the air. 

"Huzzah," cried the Ranger, clanging his blade against sword of the man he was very recently going to run through. 

"Huzzah," giggled the Enchantress, clapping her hands together and sending a tiny fireball up to dance against the blades.

"You gotta be kidding," thought Rattick as he lifted his dagger in half-hearted salute.



A few hours later, they emerged from the forest into a strange clearing and Rattick announced, "This is it."

"What do you mean?" asked the Ranger, "You mean this? It's just a door in the side of a hill." And so it was. A frame and stout oak door had been incongruously installed into the side of a well-grassed mound, perhaps 25 feet high and 50 feet around. In front of the door was a reed mat that read "Go Away."

"You expected a sign?" asked Rattick. 

"Well, I... I don't know what I expected," said the Ranger

"That's why you hired me to be your guide."

"No good fellow," protested the Ranger, "Don't wound me like that. You are no longer hireling, but boon companion, a full member of our brave band."

"Yes, yes," said Rattick, "Let us to it, boon companions" He reached for the door, but before he could open it, the Enchantress interrupted. 

"Stop! We must first seek the supplication of Lauranda. Her blessing will keep us safe during our time of trial." The Knight and the Ranger both drew their swords and knelt. Rattick rolled his eyes. Just get it over with. He didn't know how much more amateur hour he could take. But he consoled himself with the knowledge that it would all be over soon. 

The Enchantress completed her babbling, and they ventured into the Wizard's lair. It did not take long before the companions heard rumblings and gnashings of teeth from the darkness ahead.  Rattick smiled. The Troll was still there, and he sounded hungry. "Stay here, faithful companions," he said, playing it for all it is worth, "I will use my mastery of stealth and shadow to scout the way."

He handed his torch to the Ranger. He took two steps forward into the darkness of the cave. With a flourish, he wrapped his cape of faded black around him and disappeared. Rattick heard his boon companions gasp as he disappeared. 

"Oh, he's very good," said the Enchantress.

Rattick was good, but so were his tools. The cape, mean and worn as it looked, was a powerful magical item. It possessed three properties that Rattick knew of. One, when closed it imposed upon all who saw it a powerful desire to look elsewhere. Two, in anything from darkness to light shadow, it rendered the user invisible. Three, it was an item so enchanted as to be nearly impossible to steal from the rightful owner. Rattick had learned this the hard way, procuring this wonderful item only after killing its previous owner. 

"Be thankful he did not charge us more," muttered the Knight.

Again Rattick smiled at the nothingness of the dark. The bill for Rattick's services was about to come due, and the brave-but-stupid Knight would find it held many hidden charges. Rattick took a few steps around the corner and squatted in the passageway. Faithful companions? How could they fall for that? Rattick wasn't sticking his neck out any farther than he had to. He waited for a time and then unwrapped his cloak, and returned to the pool of torchlight in which his brave, faithful and gullible companions waited.

As he stepped into the light, he donned an expression of fear. With a skill long practiced, trembled as he spoke. "It is a *Troll* my companions. A creature most large and fearsome. I fear it is more than we can defeat. We should turn back."

"Ha ha ha ha!" laughed the Knight, taking the bait. "A Troll! That is nothing to a Knight of the Yarven Dawn."

"And it is even less to the blessed and Chosen of Azaz," said the Ranger, revealing the strange mark branded on his arm for what felt like the thousandth time. 

Rattick swallowed his disgust and said, "You are so much braver and stronger than I."

The Knight drew his sword and said, "Stay behind me and learn how it is done. Fear not Rattick, for you, are in the company of heroes."

"I shall not let you steal the glory!" cried the Ranger as he shouldered the Knight aside. 

Rattick couldn't believe it. The idiots charged! A frontal assault on a Troll? They were so stupid it was a wonder they could remember to breathe.. 

The Enchantress edged past him, smelling of exotic perfume. "I will see if I can bind the creature with The Mother's Embrace. Stay behind me, and you will be safe."

He followed her swaying hips through the corridor, for once, grateful for torchlight There was a roar and the stench of something awful. Rattick knew this to be the Troll's breath. Nothing smells worse than rotting flesh trapped between teeth.

When she saw the Troll the Enchantress raised her arms and began casting a spell. As her hands wove their intricate the pattern, Rattick slid his knife across her perfect, white throat. She gasped as her life's blood poured down her neck, over the exquisite Ruby necklace and into the deep valley of her heaving breasts. Before she could make another sound, Rattick covered her and dragged her into the darkness. 

She whimpered softly and grew weak. Rattick set her against the wall and removed his hand from her face. When he lifted her chin she mouthed the word, "Why?" Rattick bent down and kissed the dying woman on the lips. Her eyes fluttered as her life left the husk of her body. 

Rattick tore the necklace from her throat. Then he wiped the blood from it with a black silk handkerchief. In the distance, the screams of one the Chosen Ones ended in a terrible, squishy, bone-crunching noise.

Staring into the glittering facets of the Ruby, Rattick answered the dead woman. "Why? Because it was a kindness. Because there are worse things in the depths of this dungeon than you can imagine. Because this is what happens when you choose to play a dangerous game. All of those are close, but if you really want the truth of it". He looked up and saw that she was dead. "Because I can."


# 2 -- What's an Orc? -- 1339

Rattick threw the necklace on the oak counter and watched the light dance in it like a living thing. He nodded at it and asked, "Have you ever seen such exquisite workmanship?"

Boltac, the merchant on the other side of the counter, picked up the Ruby Necklace and examined it closely. He gave Rattick a hard look. Boltac's eyes were sharp points swathed in a soft round face. As he edged into middle age, it seemed that only his strong jaw saved his countenance from sloughing down his neck into flabbiness.

After careful consideration, Boltac licked his thumb, rubbed the necklace's setting and muttering, "you missed a spot."

"Missed a spot?" asked Rattick, as smooth as water over river rock. 

"Blood, Rattick. There's some blood left on this necklace."

Rattick shrugged. "Probably mine. I try to use stealth, but the Orc I took it from put up quite a fight."

"En-henh," Boltac said as ran his hand across his shaven pate, "Not that I want to know, but what is an Orc?"

"A fearsome new creature wreaking havoc on the good people of Robrecht."

"En-henh," said Boltac, not buying it, "And, you uh, count yourself among those good people?" 

"Of course. I am no mighty hero, like some, but I do the small part that I can."

"Okay, Rattick, I'm gonna make you an offer on your necklace here. The setting is crap, but the stone is very nice. But before I do, not for nuttin' but Orcs? You're shittin' me right?"

"Oh no, stout merchant, I assure you, Orcs are very real."

"Really? Kobolds, I heard of. Trolls, I heard of. Dragons, sure, but Orcs? C'mon. What does an Orc look like?"

"Gentle Merchant, I hope that you never see one, but I assure you, if you do, you will know for the Orc that it is."

"En-henh,"

"Let me tell you the fearsome tale of how I came to acquire this necklace and then perhaps you will better understand the threat that the fearsome Orc--"

"You can spare me the story, Rattick," said Boltac.

"You don't enjoy tales of valor?" asked Rattick with a smile.

"Tales of Valor? No. I enjoy tales of profit."

"I don't know any sagas that involve tales of profit," said Rattick, "But tales of valor, of great daring... The bards sing many songs of those."

"Yeah, I don't really care for singing either. In fact, let's just cut all the bullshit. I'm pretty sure I know how you got this."

"Yessssss," purred Rattick, running his finger over the Ruby, "but do you care?"

"Not if you'll take fifteen gold for it I don't."

"Fifteen gold? I risked my neck for this!""

"You? I'm pretty sure *you* risked somebody else's neck for this particular bauble. Fine, seventeen for the gem, and two gold for the rest of it." Boltac said, indicating the pile of equipment on the floor. 

"But this sword almost defeated a troll!"

"Yeah, and it almost doesn't have that huge nick in it. And why does everything in that pile smell like Troll shit?"

They haggled like this for a while, and settled on a price of 22 gold for the lot. When Rattick left, Boltac muttered a curse and had to work to keep from spitting on his own floor. 

He placed the Ruby in one of three lockboxes behind the counter and then dragged the bundle of equipment into the back to see how badly he had been taken. The sword was higher quality than he had hoped for, and there were a number of items that, while they wouldn't fetch top price, would provide good use. The odd piece of armor, some leather goods. He threw out a badly damaged boot and was debating about opening a nondescript fabric sack. Sacks could be trouble. For that matter so could gems. 

He grunted as he stood up. He trudged wearily back to the front of the store. From beneath the counter, he produced a brass-tipped wand that was clipped to the underside of the thick oak. He took the wand to the back and guided it carefully over all the items. 

The wand did not grow warm or shriek or vibrate or do any of the many colorful and destructive things it did in the presence of magic. The wand was not merely a magic wand. It was a magic *detecting* wand. Very rare, very expensive. But, for a man who dealt in items of unknown origins purchased from characters of questionable virtue, it was indispensable. 

"Ennh," grunted Boltac, more relieved than disappointed. Boltac hated magic. It wasn't just dangerous, it was also bad for business. When a customer couldn't try on a pair of gloves for fear that they would turn out to be MaGrief's Gauntlets of Self-Abuse, business suffered. 

That's why he kept the wand secreted under his the counter. Pick up a cursed Ruby Necklace and there was no telling what might happen. Before he had procured his wand, Boltac had spent six months with a cursed Goblet of Thirst stuck to his hand. As annoying as that was, that wasn't the worst part of the curse. When liquid was poured into the the Goblet, it heated and burned the hand that held it.

He rubbed the scarred flesh of his left hand. Ugh, magic. It seemed like it should be useful, but its power always seemed to go awry. Maybe it was fate. Maybe it was karma. Maybe it was that Wizards enjoyed a particularly cruel and ironic sense of humor. Whatever it the reason, Boltac was certain that the world would be better off without magic. But there was nothing to be done about it. People may revile a merchant, but in the end, a merchant can only sell what the buyers want. 

He pulled on a stout thong he wore around his neck and with a jingling, a cluster of charms, tokens and amulets emerged from beneath his tunic. He pawed at them for a while until he he came to an odd one cast in bronze. It was a small statue of one bull mounting another. The customary token of Dallios, Lord of the Deal. Dallios was a Southern god, little known in cold Robrecht, but when it came to religions, Boltac didn't discriminate. Boltac was a superstitious man, but he prided himself on being able to make a deal with anybody. 

He kissed the Bull with Two Backs and muttered a prayer of thanks to Dallios that, this time at least, he hadn't been the bull on the bottom.

Just then the front door clattered against its crude copper bell. A customer! The Lord of the Deal smiled on Boltac today, and hurried to see what fresh profit Dallios had seen fit to bring him. 


# 3 -- Can I Borrow a Sword -- 2247

At the front of the store, Boltac found a strapping young lad, farm boy no doubt, staring at a rack of swords with an open mouth. The boy was so entranced by the cold and lethal steel on the wall that he didn't even turn when Boltac entered the room. Boltac steped behind the counter like a Captain stepping on the deck of his ship. "Can I help you?"

"I need a sword," said the farm boy, his eyes not leaving the weaponry. 

"Then you have come to right place. Welcome, my young friend, to Boltac's General Store and Dungeon Outfittery. We have everything that a strapping young adventurer like yourself could need to loot your way to fame and glory."

"We?" asked the lad, with the kind of innocence that can only come from hard work, clean living and getting kicked in the head by livestock. 

"Yes, the Royal We, or, in this case, the Shopkeeper's We."

"But there is only one of you?"

"Yes, but I am so eager to help you, I will work as hard as two men. Now, what's the story? Who you gotta stab? Who you gonna loot?"

"No," said the Farm Boy as he hung his head in embarrassment, "It's not like that. I don't want to loot anybody. I… I just have to… I mean, I am about to embark on an adventure of high purpose and consequence." With this last phrase, Boltac's hopes rose. Maybe the kid was a little slow, but those fancy words sounded like money to Boltac. He smiled like a fleshy shark.

"My friend, you have come to the right place. High purpose and consequence is what we are all about at Boltac's. Why the Duke of Robrecht himself has granted me my license to purvey. He has an eye to quality, his Dukeship does, and his warrant of commerce personally guarantees that this," he indicated his dark, dusty store with an expansive gesture of his hands, "Is the finest merchandise you can buy in town of Robrecht."

"But, yours is the only store in the Duke allows in the town of Robrecht."

"Yes, I see that you are a quick study," said Boltac, directing the young man back through the shelves. "I invite you to direct your keen wit towards my wares. Here we have an assortment of torches and oil-bearing devices. If you notice this one -- with the curved blade on the handle -- particularly good if you are surprised coming around a corner."

Boltac turned the Farm Boy sharply and indicated a floor-to-ceiling rack of glass bottles, "Here, of course, we have our major and minor healing potions -- antidotes, ointments and ungents of all kinds. A must for any prudent adventurer. These potions are brewed by the finest Mercian apothecaries and brought in by mule train once a moon."

Moving right along, Boltac directed his young shopper towards the racks in the back, "And here is the Armor. A must for all but barbarians and the most self-confident magic workers. You aren't a magic worker are you?"

"I don't think so," said the lad, a little overwhelmed by how fast this was all coming at him. 

"Perfect, then you have your choice of chain mail, splint mail, ring mail, plate mail, plate armor and  -- far less protection but the girls love it -- leather armor. Feel that? Very supple."

"But what I need is a sword," protested the Farm Boy.

"En-henh," said Boltac, "Which brings us to back to lighting. A question of prominent importance to any adventurer."

The Farm Boy looked longingly back at the swords.

"I know, I know," continued Boltac. "You think the thing with the pointy end is the most important bit of gear you can buy."

"A hero's life depends on the strength of his blade." 

"Sometimes. But there are two things, I can *guarantee* you are going to need. 1) Water. 2) Light."

"What about food?"

"Eh, you can live for days without food. A strong lad like you could eat what he kills, but without water… not so much. And the dark. Are you comfortable in the dark?"

"I have walked this land at night since I was a small child."

"And now that you're a big child… I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm just having fun. My point here is, you know what lives far, far underground, in the darkness?"

"I do not, but I am ready to boldly face the unknown."

"Ennn-henh. You got no idea. For that matter, neither do I. But what I *do* know is that whatever horrible underground thing you mean to bash to a pulp in the name of your personal fame or fortune, you can bet that, *it* can see in the dark."

The Farm Boy stood there with a brave, yet stupid look on his face.

"And you know what can't see in the dark?"

"Uh…"

"You. You can't see in the dark. Can you?"

"No."

"Then trust me, you pain-in-the-ass, take a lantern. In fact, take two and some torches, just in case."

"What about that one," the Farm Boy asked, pointing to a lamp that hung on its own peg high on the wall. 

"Oh, that, you have a very good eye, my friend. That is the magic lantern of Lamptopolis. It cannot be broken and it never goes out as long as it's carried."

"Lamptopolis?" asked the Farm Boy.

"Okay, you caught me, I made it up. But it's a lantern and it's clearly magic."

"It's beautiful. How does it work?"

"It's magic. That's how it works. Some kinda glowing crystal in the center there. You pick it up it turns on. But trust me, it can't be broken."

"How do you know that?"

"Ennh, you've never had apprentices have you? Third rule of shopkeeping: If a thing can't
