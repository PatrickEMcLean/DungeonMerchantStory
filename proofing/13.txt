leave this dimension. And we will be released."

"So, ya telling me there's a way to snuff out magic? Like a candle?"

"But only a hero, a true hero, one chosen by fate and circumstance can overcome the Wizard and quench the torrent of magic. That is why you --"

"Wait a minute. Wait a minute! You're saying I'm the chosen one? Like *chosen*. Look buddy, no offense, but I'm just a guy trying to make a coin in this world, you understand?"

"In your heart, there is love."

"Love of coin, of course."

"There is more," said the UnderKing, "Do not lie to me. Do not lie in this place of all places. There is no bargain you can make with the final darkness."

"There's always room to negotiate."

"Not at the very end."

"C'mon, all the stories and the sagas and the miracle turnarounds."

Silence. 

"Look, I'm not your guy. I'm sorry. The guy you wanted, your *hero*, is lying up there in a pool of his own blood and entrails. He was an idiot, but he was the better man. No thought for himself at all. What a Jackass! I wish I could be like him, but I'm not. I'm not your hero, so."

"What of the girl?" the UnderKing asked.

"What, Asarah? Okay, look, I love her. I do. And I figured it out too late.  I blew it. So now I'm here, where ever the hell *here* is. I got the kid killed and there's nuttin' I can do about any of it. It sucks, but that's business. I can't save her. I... can't..."

Wise in the ways of patience, the UnderKing said nothing.

"I can't even save myself. I thought I was a smart guy. I thought I had a clever plan, but now... none of my plans are clever. I'm just a fool. So, you know, kill me or whatever you're going to do."

"You are a broken thing," said the UnderKing.

"Yeah. Broken. No resale value whatsoever. So what do I do now?"

"When in darkness, follow the light," said the UnderKing as his voice retreated from Boltac.

"What? There's no light down here. It's the bottom of a bottomless pit!"

# 36 -- Follow the light. -- 810

Boltac sat in the dark for a long time. There are many more gradations of darkness than the human eye can see. In fact, it is correct to say that humans cannot see any kind of darkness at all, only light. But there is always a catch. As Boltac stared into that endless night and saw nothing, he realized there was a patch of blackness that he couldn't see, but it was a patch of blackness that he couldn't see a little less than all the other blackness surrounding it. 

Very slowly, and with many groans, he got to his feet. His clothes, what were left of them, were in tatters. But when he felt his limbs and torso, he realized that, somehow, he had been made whole. His ribs had stopped moving under his skin like a sack of broken sticks. The strange pads and paws of the Broken Ones had somehow set him to rights. For a moment, he considered that he might be a thing shaped as much as they were. 

"You are a broken thing." The UnderKing's words echoed in his ears. In the gigantic silence that surrounded him, the imagined voice was deafening. 

Boltac took a step towards the less dark darkness. It was unnerving to walk blindly. He slid his foot across the floor. Expecting a pit, or a knife in his back or any one of a thousand injuries or tortures or traps that his mind conjured in the absence of anything to look at. 

Even moving at a snail's pace, Boltac broke out a cold sweat. But inch by inch, he moved forward. After a time he could not measure, he realized that the unseeable floor beneath his feet was sloping upward. But to where? How far had he fallen? There might have been no such thing as a bottomless pit, but there were surely deep, deep holes in the earth.

He came to a wall and felt his way along it in the dark. His hands clung to every fissure and rough place with greed and desperation, as if he could fall off into the darkness and be lost for ever. As he walked, he was overcome with the hopelessness of his position. He was miles underground and could wander forever -- or at least until dehydration killed him -- without ever finding his way out. 

"Follow the light?" Boltac called out. "Hey! I'm talking to you. I know there's something out there... in here... whatever..." he said, assured at first, but his voice trailing off at the end. He thought for a while about all the somethings that could be out there in the darkness. Maybe yelling was a bad idea. Maybe breathing was a bad idea. Maybe everything was a bad idea. 

Boltac lay his head against the wall and fought back tears. As silent sobs wracked his body, his necklace of charms made infinitesimal jingling noises against the stone. Did he have a ward against being trapped underground? He'd have to get one of those. When he got out of here that would be the first thing he would do. Surely those barbarous, tanned, Southroners had a God of the UnderDark or some such. Who did the UnderKing worship, Boltac wondered? *Somewhere, *somebody* a charm against this kind of thing, and Boltac would find it. 

Wiping his tears away with what remained of his sleeve, Boltac pressed on. A few steps later, he found an opening in the wall and in it, stairs. As he climbed, he realized that the steps were cut for a creature with a smaller stride than a human. It made climbing them even harder than climbing regular stairs. But even though his legs cramped and his lungs burned, he climbed. Not quickly. Not as a young man like Relan might, but slowly and without stopping. 


When the sound of Boltac's footsteps rising from the UnderDark had faded, Samga spoke to the UnderKing. "I told you he was not the one."

"It is not done yet," said the UnderKing. 

"He's no Chosen One. He cannot release us from the Master."

"Maybe it is not the one who is Chosen who can save us, Samga. Maybe it is the one who *chooses*."

"I have been away too long," said Samga, leaving his King. 

"I will await his return for a time."

"Of course," said Samga, "All you ever do is sit in the dark, and wait."

Samga followed his own scent-trail back to the secret fissure he would climb back to the Wizard's dungeon. He had thought he was out range of the UnderKing, but all of a sudden his voice was there beside him. 

"It's not all sitting and waiting, Samga. The darkness is where an Orc can look inward, for here is nothing else to see."

"We were made hollow. We are empty inside."

"It is not done yet," said the UnderKing, knowing that those words were always true. 


# 37 -- Boltac Turns back. -- 1659

Boltac had stumbled through darkness for what felt like days. The stairs he had climbed ended in another darkened level. Again, he felt his way towards the lighter darkness. He stumbled into walls. Once he almost fell into a pit. His nerves became numb to the constant strain, even as his hands cramped with the effort of extending outward as far as his fingers could reach. Eventually, the ache reached all the way to his shoulders. 

He was on the verge of giving up, when he felt a faint stirring of air. It was not the heavy, hopeless stale of the depths. It was light and sweet, like a cool drink of water on a hot summer day. His lungs drank it in greedily. And with his face and nose he followed the movement of that impossible breeze.

He rounded a corner and then he saw it. Light. Not the brightness of a new day dawning. Not even the faint light of a candle guttering its last spark in a pool of melted tallow. It was, perhaps, the faintest light which a man can see. But in comparison from the darkened places of the earth from which he had traveled it was a beacon to light his way. He hurried and fell. Got up and fell again. Climbed stairs using his hands and feet. Then a passage to the left, then more stairs and then, there it was a chink in the wall. A pure beam of sunlight in this darkened place. 

He followed the beam to a crack in the wall. It was a hole in an ancient stone door, choked with vines on the other side. After a struggle with the stone, he was able to pull it open. Grass and vine fell in, and he pushed his way out, through sod, into the sunlight and open air.

He was high on the side of a mountain, facing East, and the light was the sunrise. Near him, a spring burbled down the slope. Boltac drank greedily from it. It was so clear and cold it caused his teeth to ache. When he splashed it upon his shaven pate, the shock of it sparked through him an emotion that was very much like hope. Realizing he was alive, free and in the light of a new day, Boltac laughed as he had not laughed for years. 

A short walk in the sunlight, a gentle stroll downhill, around the base of this mountain and he would be on the road back home. He had it on good authority that some people even enjoyed such walks in the woods. 

And then what? Sell what was left in his store. Buy a boat and head South? A leisurely drift down the river swift. Some fishing along the way. Bonfires on the riverbank at night. 

And then what? A shop or trading stall in Yorn or in the swamp-ringed Squalipoor? Surely he would not stop in Shatnapur? That would be too close to Robrecht. Too close to memories. Too close to...

And then what? To build a business again. Make back something of the fortune he lost. He could do it. Wasn't he a lucky man? As he thought this, he jangled the necklace of charms and wards. A lucky man. Luck earned with hard work and the money it had brought. 

And then what? His ease in old age, perhaps a place to put his feet up? He wasn't too old to dream of a family. A vineyard, something productive, not too far out of a city, but away from the bustle. And then, as an old man, the busy-ness of his life complete, he would put his feet on the hearth, sip the wine that was too good to sell, and he would have time to think.

To think of Relan falling to the stone floor. The look of confusion on his face that said, "But this can't happen. I am the hero!" Asarah lost to him. As lost to him as if she were dead. But her scream, her wails, crying for him. Would he not hear that screaming echo for the rest of his life. 

He turned back to the door. "Who am I kidding?" he asked the bright new day. "I'm just gonna get myself killed. I'm not the chosen one. Who chose me? Who would choose me? I'm not a hero. I don't have broad shoulders or a strong chin? I'm not even young anymore."

He turned away from the door. "It was a bad deal from the beginning. But you got away with your skin. It's a sunk cost, Boltac. Take the hit and walk away." He nodded to himself as if that that ended the argument. Good. Sensible. Mercantile. Just a bad deal. But when he went to walk away, his feet moved in the wrong direction. 

He fingered the necklace thick with charms and had a thought. It was a bad idea. It had all been bad ideas. "You make your own luck," said Boltac. 

He took a whiff of fresh air. He said goodbye to the trees and the green grass and the water pure and dancing through rocks. The clouds parted and the sun was too bright. He squinted and made a silent, last goodbye the world. Then headed back into the darkness. It was a bad deal all right, thought Boltac. But he had made it, and he wasn't going to break it. 

His life at risk? Sure, thought Boltac. But that was nothing. It wasn't just the sum of all his yesterdays he had put up to finance this ill-advised expedition. It was the promise of all his tomorrows. Unless he saw this thing through, there would be no ease by the fire. There would be no pleasure in shrewd trading and crisp profits. There would be no living with himself. 

Fine, thought Boltac. She loves me not. But I love her still. Gods help me. I cannot do anything else. A thought surfaced in his mind: I guess that makes me some kind of hero. As he closed the door behind him, he answered his mind's foolishness with a skeptical, "En-henh."

It was harder to go back. Now he could appreciate how stagnant the air really was down here. Each step still came with fear, but now they were robbed of hope and anticipation. He imagined he knew what waited for him at the bottom of the pit. So he followed the darkness, sinking in the blackness; this time following the compass of stale fear and dry death that welled up within him.

When at last he came to the gigantic, silent room, he stood listening for a time. He heard nothing but took a chance anyway. "I know you're there," he said.

"You have returned," said the UnderKing "Why?"

"I need to find a way up."

"We told you, to find your way out, you must follow the light."

"Not *out*, back up. Into the mess. And with all the crap the Wizard has thrown down his hidey hole, you can't tell me there's not a friggin' torch down here somewhere."

"But this is the UnderDark. The Kingdom of things discarded that want to be forgotten," said the UnderKing.

"Yeah, yeah, that's one hell of pitch for tourism, but if you want to me to take on this crazy Wizard at the height of his power, I better get moving."

In the darkness, a light appeared. It was a torch, and though it was  soaked in oil and burning well, the darkness did not give up easily. It pressed in on all sides. As the torch was lifted, Boltac saw that it was Samga who held it. And to his left, stood a simpler, cruder version of an Orc that wore a crown of bent and twisted metal. The UnderKing closed his eyes and still shielded them from the light with his claw. The UnderKing's features seemed like they were drawn in crayon, simple and plain. A moon face, mere holes for ears and a scribble for mouth. His simple symmetry was interrupted by a leg bent underneath him. It was twisted as if it had shattered in a fall and never properly reset. 

"Uh," began Boltac, but then he realized that the emptiness of the pit was anything but empty. At the very edges of the feeble light cast by the torch, were creatures keeping to the dark. Some walked, some crawled, some shambled.

"Release. Release. Release." They all whispered in unison. Yet when they moved, they did not make a sound. 

Boltac tore his eyes away from the shapes in the darkness and looked at Samga. "Why are you helping me? Why do you betray your Master?"

"Do you have a master?"

"No."

"Do you want one?"

"No."

"Neither do I. He is my King," Samga nodded towards the UnderKing. Then he looked up and said, "He is my captor."

"Okay, well, good enough for me. Now let's talk about how we are going to do this. We need to be patient. Take our time. Make no mistakes. We're only gonna get one shot at this guy."

Samga's expression did not change when he said, "He has bled the boy dry to lure the flame and soon will sacrifice the woman. By so doing, he means to weld the flame to his power. 

"What?"

"It is blood magic. The force that binds mother to child, father to son and clan to clan. Very old and very powerful," said Samga.

"You forgot *very* crazy," said Boltac.

"He hungers for power and cares not how he gets it."

"En-henh. Okay, no offense to your hospitality here, King, but we need to get a move on. I'm late for an appointment to do something stupid."

Not opening his eyes, the UnderKing said, "Blessings be upon you, One who has Chosen."

"En-henh. I see what you did there."

As Samga walked away, the broken ones skittered out of the range of light. Boltac followed. He didn't feel lucky, but at least he didn't feel broken anymore. 


# 38 -- The Wizard, Killing Relan -- 689

When the Wizard had returned to his sanctum, Asarah crept as far under the table as her chain would allow. She sat wide-eyed and frozen like a rabbit who hopes the fox does not see her. 

But, at that moment, Dimsbury had no attention to spare for her. As soon as he entered the room he was drawn to the flame. He muttered to himself, "Brighter. More resolved. But how can this be?" Dimsbury looked around the chamber. He waved a hand at the wall sconces, and they burst into flame. They overpowered the uncertain light of the magic flame and filled the room with an honest, if sooty, light. 

A glance at the floor revealed the cause. From Relan's body, a rivulet of blood stretched across the floor to the dais on which the flame sat. "Could it be?" Dimsbury asked. He removed the glass cover from the flame. Although there was no wind, the flames curved over the side of the dais. Dimsbury bent and dipped his fingers into the blood. He held them above the flame, and as blood dripped downward into the confluence of magic, it was transformed through a brilliant range of hues, and seemed more substantial at the end of it.

Dimsbury turned to what was left of Relan and said, "You're not completely useless after all, what a surprise."


The Wizard wasted no time in having Relan strung up by his ankles over the flame. What little blood remained in the poor boy dripped into the cool, hypnotic light. The unflames licked greedily at the blood and became a little more focused and defined with each drop. 

Asarah wept at this horrible sight. She wept for Relan. He had tried to be a hero and he had failed. And now the stuff of his life was drained out to... it was horrible. She also wept for herself. That that this should be her state and condition. That she would meet her end here, under the Earth. And, it is true, she wept for Boltac. He was no hero. He was not equipped to even save himself. But in the end, he had come for her. 

She had forgotten her earlier words, but now they came back to her. "But that's how she *knows* that he truly loves her." Boltac wasn't a prince. This wasn't a storybook or a saga, but he had come for her. It was not what she expected from romance, but it was true. Or had been. Now Boltac was dead, not to return. And she had been so cruel to him. 

Grief piled upon grief and sorrow upon sorrow, but she was so afraid, she dared not give voice to her pain. Silent tears streamed down her face as if they could flood the interior of the Earth. 

When Relan's blood had stopped flowing, Dimsbury swung him away from the flame and hacked the cords holding him up with a knife. The lad's body fell to the floor in an awful heap. 

Without looking at Asarah, Dimsbury addressed her in a voice loud enough to make her jump. "My dear, I have good news and bad news!"

She did not answer. She did not even move. 

"The good news is that I no longer require you to be my cook."

All thought left Asarah. She s. 

"Seize her," Dimsbury commanded. The screaming was perfect, thought Dimsbury. It was all according to form. The way such things were to be done But the Orcs did not move towards her. This wasn't right at all. It made her scream seem pointless and silly. 

Exasperated, Dimsbury exclaimed, "Her, there under the table. Grab her. Her. THAT ONE!" He made wild, uninterpretable thrashing gestures with his hands. "The screaming one!"

The Orcs finally got the idea and seized the woman. As they dragged her out, she struggled so violently that she knocked herself unconscious on the table leg. passed out and stopped screaming. As Dimsbury watched the Orcs tie her feet to the ropes that would dangle her above the Flame of Magic, he wondered aloud, "Where did Samga go? He was here just a minute ago."


# 39 -- In the Hall of Metallic Gluttony -- 1892

Rattick had not pushed his luck. After killing the boy, he had left the Wizard's presence as quickly as possible. Sure, there was the question of payment owed, but Rattick knew as well as anyone that dead men collect no tolls or tithes. Best to stay alive, for there was no profit in death. The Orcs carried Boltac's sack high above their heads, fighting over it as they raced to the Great Hall. Rattick followed in the shadows, waiting for his chance to grab something of value before he escaped from the madness of the Wizard's lair. Why were rich people always so dangerously out of touch with reality, Rattick wondered?

The Great Hall was ambitiously named yet modestly furnished. A large cavern off the main passage, it was a darker analog of a refectory at a traditional boy's school. Large wooden tables with benches had once been lined up here. Now half of them were pushed into a jumble at the far end of the room. A mock fireplace and mantle piece carved into the living rock, was full to overflowing with bits of discarded bone and gristle. Here and there a wolf nosed through the scraps. Even to Rattick, this jumbled room looked like the end of a civilization. 

Concealed by his cloak, he climbed the wall and shimmied down a thick iron chain to a long unused chandelier. There he took up his perch and watched and
