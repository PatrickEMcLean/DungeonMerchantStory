I've had this thing I've needed to get out of my system. It's writing a heroic tale without a hero in it. How to Succeed in Evil, my first book, is a really smart guy in a world of superpowered people. And he succeeds because he's smart, ruthless and (in a very strange way) reasonable. The book you hold in your hands (or file you hold on your digital device) represents another one of those stories. And it had a very strange genesis. 

I kicked my way into a gig writing and designing levels for an RPG. 



Explain that Relan is the character that I beat Ultima III with. Twice.

Just as Wizardry is the granddaddy of all merchants and stores. Boltac is the granddaddy of all merchants and stores in CRPG. To understand how magnificent this character (really store, we never learn much about the man himself except (he'll sell you his arms)) his character is merely imputed from his actions (as everyone's is I guess.)

Boltac is then, a perfectly ruthless market. Arbitraging his monopoly privileged fully and perfectly every single time. In economic terms, he had perfect knowledge of the elasticity of demand. Something companies would give their eyeteeth to have perfect knowledge about. Perfect knowledge does not exist. And the whole of useful, durable knowledge about pricing can be summed up 

If you've ever negotiated a salary or a project payment or for the purchase of a brightly colored statue, then you'll know that feeling -- that awful lingering feeling that you might have left money on the table -- but that's just the thing with Boltac. He never left money on the table. And he never lost a sale because he asked for too much.

-- In short, he must have been the greatest Merchant there ever was. 

What's a story about that guy like?

To be honest, I have this predilection for telling ordinary tough-guy tales with people who are cunning rather than strong as protagonists (see also, How to Succeed in Evil) I also like business and know something about it. Where most  writers seem know very little about how a market economy functions and like the idea of it even less. 

Not that I can blame them. Selling books is a rough gig.  Making good ones I'd even harder.  It is always easier to blame something external for your own shortcomings. That's why Steve Martin's advice is so profound for me. Be so good they cannot deny you. 

But this time was a little different. This magnificent character was lurking there all the time. And to have the fat merchant be the guy who turns out to be the hero -- well shit -- that's unexpected at every turn. 

So I just had to write it.
