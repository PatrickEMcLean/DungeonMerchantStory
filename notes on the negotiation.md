"It's so romantic. And he goes to rescue her and when he *does* rescue her that's how she *knows*."

"Eeeeyeah. You keep saying that. Knows what?"

"That he *loves* her. That he really, truly loves her above all others."

"That's how she'll know he's a muscle-headed idiot who's good with a sword."

"But he can't because some fat, greedy merchant wouldn't loan him a sword."

"No," said Boltac, pushing his anger back down, "I could loan him a sword and armor and everything else in my store. He can't because he DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO USE A SWORD!"

"Keep your voice down," hissed Asarah. You're disturbing the other patrons!"

"Patron," quipped Boltac across his empty tankard and gesturing at the nearly empty common room. 

Asarah slammed another ale down in front of him and said. "There's no romance in your life. No passion. No wonder you are alone. I feel sorry for you Boltac." And then she stormed off into the back. 


# Dimsbury and Boltac 

Is she you wife?

"No? No!" said Boltac, flustered by the question. She's not my, I mean... No. I just come here a lot on account of my shop is across the street. We're just good friends, that's all. Quit raising your eyebrow at me like that."


Dimsbury lowered his eyebrow but did not look away. Boltac could not hold his stare, and looked down at his plate of lamb.

"This lamb is delicious," Boltac muttered, taking another bite. 

"Yes. It is. She might not be your wife, but you love her all the same," said Dimsbury. "I recognized love. I have made a systematic study of all human weakness, you know."

"Human weakness, heh, love ain't a weakness, Mister."

"To love is to give Hostages to Fortune."


"I don't know anything about that, I ain't in love with her. But I am in love with her lamb."


"Yes," said Dimsbury, letting it go and returning his attention to his food. 



# Asarah and Boltac

> He has to bring it around to "that's how you'll know."

>Asarah doesn't want to admit weakness -- Boltac struggles with this -- "It's not weakness let someone love you", he said.
