There's an old writer's joke -- "There's only five plots, only nobody can agree on which five they are." But whatever classification, taxonomy or bestiary of story that makes the most sense to you, there is one element that is (almost quite literally) in everybody's book -- The Descent into the Underworld.

It's in the first written story we have, the Epic of Gilgamesh. It's an essential part of Christian Theology. "Christ was crucified, died and descended into Hell"[^apostles]. In The Empire Strikes Back, Luke descends into a cave to be tested, kills the image of Darth Vader and sees his own face beneath the mask. He comes out with the knowledge that he is not yet a Jedi. The Goonies

And it's the model for perhaps the most successful greatest story trope in video games. The Dungeon Crawl. 

The Odyessy : Odesseus literally descends into hell seeking the knowledge that will get him home safely. 

The Inferno : Dante descends into hell seeking the ultimate knowledge, love.

The Shawshank Redemption : Crawls through a sewage pipe and is transformed into a free man.

Godfather : Michael dies, goes to Italy, and comes back transformed

Lord of the Rings : Gandalf the Grey descends into Moria, dies and comes back as Gandalf the White.

Lawrence of Arabia : 


It's one of the oldest tropes in literature. Maybe even the oldest trope. But it's also one of the most used. But it hasn't worn out. 

I mean, it's in the oldest story we have, the Epic of Gilgamesh. The structure is always the same -- a hero goes down (usually into the world of the afterlife) and returns with new knowledge. 


[^apostles]: From the Apostle's creed. Central to the Catholic, Anglican, Methodist and Lutheran faiths. [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostles%27_Creed)


" Trust me, everybody agrees on this trope.
It's easy to take things like D&D for granted. And there are surely generations of people who play WoW who have 


Writing a book is largely a matter of asking questions. At the beginning, you start with, "Hey, I wonder what would happen if?" or, in the case of non-fiction, "Why is is ________ so interesting?" In the swampy middle of any extended work the questions turn ugly. More like,  "What am I doing? Why am I such a hack? How am I ever going to finish this thing?"

But behind all of these questions is the one Ur-question that all writers ask, all the time. "What's really going on here?" So, when I wrote a book that involved a dungeon crawl, I asked myself, where did this theme come from -- The Descent into the Underworld?


A descent into the underworld. It's one of the oldest tropes in literature. Maybe even the oldest trope. A hero goes down (usually dying) and returns with new knowledge.

The an old writer's joke goes, there's only five stories, only nobody can agree on which five they are. Trust me, everybody agrees on this trope.

I believe in God,
the Father almighty,
Creator of heaven and earth,
and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died and was buried;
he descended into hell;
on the third day he rose again from the dead;
he ascended into heaven,
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;
from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit,
the holy catholic Church,
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. Amen.[23][24]
