Boltac didn't say anything. He looked away and his eyes unfocused as the memories tried to come flooding back. He took a long pull on the ale, gulping down nearly half of it. 

"If you please, good merchant, I have something I would like to sell," a snake whispered in Boltac's ear and broke the spell. 

He turned to his right and beheld Rattick, too large and too watery eyes trying to fool him with their great sincerity. The glowed like great moons of reassurance. So dazzling they were that it was difficult to notice the pale, dead face that never smiled around them. Or, Boltac assumed, the knife that was coming to slit the strings on your coinpurse. 

"Ah Rattick," he said, "Have you taken those poor fools last coin before they could drink it." 

"No," Rattick sighed with great sincerity, "but if I had, just if mind you, would that be so terrible? So parasitic? After all, we are all suffering from an economic downturn of such proportion, such magnitude, that bringing coin here to Robrecht and keeping it here, why it is a matter of our very survival. 

"Economic? That's a very large word for you Rattick," Boltac said. 

"You should not be so unkind to me, stout merchant. Besides, it would be a sin to let them take their coin with them on their planned outing 

"It seems a sin to let them wander off into the hills and die, leaving their remaining coin festering at the bottom of some dark fen, troll pit or bottomless chasm." At this, Boltac clinked glasses with the weasel of a man sitting next to him. He might have been shady, disreputable, but he wasn't wrong. Besides, the man was thief. It was his job. And unlike all of the other adventurers who festered and waited in Robrecht -- Rattick was actually good at what he did. 

"Yes, you see that one there," Rattick continued, "The one with the pan for a helmet. Yes, he is the *chosen one*."

"Ah, of course, sent to to free us from the awful shadow of the wizard who has occupied the nearby tower."

"Cavern, actually. Rumor has it the old Matteschitz mine collapsed into a gigantic, secret cavern in the earth."

"Oh, ah, of course. Cavern. How silly of me," said Boltac.

"And even know, the great wizard Oddna searches beneath the earth for relics and powers of which man was not meant to know." 

"Which, will inevitably bring about the destruction of all of the Duchy of Robrecht," said Boltac, filling in the next verse. And recognizing it for the lie it was. He had never met the Wizard Oddna, and hoped he never would -- he hated magic in a way that only a trader with a lust for certain, right and ordinary commerce can. -- but if a man wanted to dig for objects in the earth, why shouldn't he? As for the tales of horrible things happening and monsters roaming the land, Boltac couldn't help but notice that these stories, and the twisted corpses and wrecked adventurers who had retunred, had only started turning up after adventurers had gone out in search of Oddna's loot. Boltac knew what he would do to anyone he caught robbing his store...

"Yes, but of course. But thankfully, the chosen one is here to save us."

"Hmm, thankfully."

"Only, there is one, unexpected problem for this auspicious young man on his world-healing hero quest."

"Yes,"

"You see the tall one, in the Mage's robe."

"Yes, the one covered in silly mystical symbols as only a true mage can be?"

"Yes. Turns out, he's the chosen one. Too."

"Ahh, so the chosen two."

"Yes, I fear it will not end well for their party, but enough of the misfortunes of others. I have a certain item that I have come into possession of a certain item which I am certain you will be interested."

"Step into my office," said Boltac, as he slid off the stool and made his way to the door. But not before casting a longing look towards the kitchen. What would 

CH 3 -- the problem with magic items

Asarah -- but you see that's how she knows he loves her. He comes for her, risks everything against all odds for the love of his life. 

Boltac -- that's how she knows he's an idiot. 

Asarah -- You're a bitter, bitter man. 

Boltac -- What because I make good sense?

Asarah -- Because there's no romance in your life. No passion. No magic. 

Ugh, thought Boltac. Magic that's worse than romance

-Isn't that right, Asarah?" but when he turned back, she was gone.
