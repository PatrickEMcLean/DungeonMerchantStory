C'mon, kid, keep you're head up, you're the hero of this story.

Boltac's facade cracks a little. It's one thing to play hard and fast with someone who has some power -- who knows the game and takes the risk. But Relan, -- that brave idiot, gah -- the Wizard should pick on somebody in his own IQ bracket. 

"no, I let you down."

"Don't talk silly, you saved my life. At least once. You just rest easy, just bleed quietly into the floor, I'll get you out of here soon enough."

Samga, leave him to die slowly. But when he his done, you may feed him to Orc's

"They will be so pleased Master," said Samga.

"I am a good and gentle master, am I not?" 

"The finest master," said Samga. 


When he's finished dying, 

No

* No, I wouldn't want everything you jackass. Then I'd have to pay the upkeep on *everything*. And believe you me, that's expensive. Besides, if I had everything, who would I haggle with?

The very end

En-henh. Battlemages? I'm just going out on a limb here. You're battlemages haven't really been coming through for you lately. Say, the last four or five days."

"They have informed me that the alignment of the spheres has not been favorable for the use of magic," Torvalds grumbled.



"En-henh. Is that one of them over there? Right there?" asked Boltac

He pointed at a man wearing a gigantic, awkward hat and dark robes embroidered with moons and stars and planets

"You, in the funny hat! Yeah, Jackass. I'm talking at you." When Boltac addressed the man with the phrase Jackass, all of the onlookers gasped in terror. One did not speak to Master BattleMage in such tones. Not even Torvalds, in his blackest moods, forgot his manners when dealing with such powerful men. 

"Oh, that got ya dander up, eh?" Boltac said, enjoying tweaking this guy a little more. "Well, strike me down. C'mon, lighting, fire and brimstone, pull a rabbit out of a hat and throw it at me, whatever ya got."

Boltac waddled over to the man in his dark, expensive robes. The BattleMage was red-faced and sputtering with rage. Several spectators turned away. But the Mage did nothing. Boltac reached up and knocked the hat off his head. It's fine, silk trimmed felt rolled in the dust and muck of the road. 

"MABADI!" he cried, jumping back and throwing his hands towards Boltac. Somewhere in the crowd a lady screamed. But nothing happened. The Battle Mage looked at his hands, hung his head and walked away. 

"En-henh. You got nothing!" said Boltac

"I, on the other hand, have an army," said Torvalds.

I'm the conquering hero. 

"No you're not?" said Weeveston, "You're the merchant!"

It's easy to see how you would be bitter and deny my story. But everybody who hears that is just going to thing you are bigger losers than you already are. So go ahead. Cast aspersions, just makes me look better.
