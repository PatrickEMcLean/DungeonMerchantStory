SCENE: Boltac negotiates

They argue. The trap is sprung. Relan leaps in to defend him, but as he's drawing his sword, Rattick clubs him down. Asarah shrieks.

Boltac says, just the man I wanted to see. 

They negotiate

Why don't I just take all of it? 

I wouldn't do that if I were you --- some of those things in there are dangerous. Not what you want to be messing around with. 

But I am a mighty Wizard. 

Okay, so I'll repeat myself and say it again slower this time. Some of those things in there --

Enough, you grow tiresome.


## Things we need to do to wrap the scene

1) Boltac in hole -- wooden circle shattered on the ceiling.

SCENE: Underking

I should be dead.

"Someday, you will be," said the voice in the darkness. 

Is it magic?

No it is not magic, just one flawed creature caring for another.

The very end

En-henh. Battlemages? I'm just going out on a limb here. You're battlemages haven't really been coming through for you lately. Say, the last four or five days."

"They have informed me that the alignment of the spheres has not been favorable for the use of magic," Torvalds grumbled.



"En-henh. Is that one of them over there? Right there?" asked Boltac

He pointed at a man wearing a gigantic, awkward hat and dark robes embroidered with moons and stars and planets

"You, in the funny hat! Yeah, Jackass. I'm talking at you." When Boltac addressed the man with the phrase Jackass, all of the onlookers gasped in terror. One did not speak to Master BattleMage in such tones. Not even Torvalds, in his blackest moods, forgot his manners when dealing with such powerful men. 

"Oh, that got ya dander up, eh?" Boltac said, enjoying tweaking this guy a little more. "Well, strike me down. C'mon, lighting, fire and brimstone, pull a rabbit out of a hat and throw it at me, whatever ya got."

Boltac waddled over to the man in his dark, expensive robes. The BattleMage was red-faced and sputtering with rage. Several spectators turned away. But the Mage did nothing. Boltac reached up and knocked the hat off his head. It's fine, silk trimmed felt rolled in the dust and muck of the road. 

"MABADI!" he cried, jumping back and throwing his hands towards Boltac. Somewhere in the crowd a lady screamed. But nothing happened. The Battle Mage looked at his hands, hung his head and walked away. 

"En-henh. You got nothing!" said Boltac

"I, on the other hand, have an army," said Torvalds. 


----

I'm the conquering hero. 

"No you're not?" said Weeveston, "You're the merchant!"

It's easy to see how you would be bitter and deny my story. But everybody who hears that is just going to thing you are bigger losers than you already are. So go ahead. Cast aspersions, just makes me look better.
