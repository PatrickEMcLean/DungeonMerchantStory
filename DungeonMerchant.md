## Intro

wwwwwwdwwwdwwwawwww - takes me through the darkneess

Just as Wizardry is the granddaddy of all merchants and stores. Boltac is the granddaddy of all merchants and stores in CRPG. To understand how magnificent this character (really store, we never learn much about the man himself except (he'll sell you his arms)) his character is merely imputed from his actions (as everyone's is I guess.)

Boltac is then, a perfectly ruthless market. Arbitraging his monopoly privileged fully and perfectly every single time. In economic terms, he had perfect knowledge of the elasticity of demand. Something companies would give their eyeteeth to have perfect knowledge about. Perfect knowledge does not exist. And the whole of useful, durable knowledge about pricing can be summed up 

If you've ever negotiated a salary or a project payment or for the purchase of a brightly colored statue, then you'll know that feeling -- that awful lingering feeling that you might have left money on the table -- but that's just the thing with Boltac. He never left money on the table. And he never lost a sale because he asked for too much.

-- In short, he must have been the greatest Merchant there ever was. 

What's a story about that guy like?

To be honest, I have this predilection for telling ordinary tough-guy tales with people who are cunning rather than strong as protagonists (see also, How to Succeed in Evil) I also like business and know something about it. Where most  writers seem know very little about how a market economy functions and like the idea of it even less. 

But this time was a little different. This magnificent character was lurking there all the time. And to have the fat merchant be the guy who turns out to be the hero -- well shit -- that's unexpected at every turn. 

So I just had to write it.

## Chapter 1

Colbac was eating a mutton sandwich from the Inn across the street. The Inn, which was the only Inn in town, in the same way that Colbac's was the only store in town, was justly famous for a full range of mutton dishes. Quite improbably these included a  mutton tort with a honey glaze that was one of the chief reasons Colbac was as wide as he was tall. Well, that and the Ale. 

Colbac lifted a tankard of the good red ale and washed down a mouthful of greasy meat. There was a time when he would not have eaten and drank alone at the end of a working day. He would have come out from behind his thick oak counter, flipped the sign in the window, activated the charm of warding and gone across the street to sit by the roaring fire, eat, drink and otherwise be merry. But those days were past. Now Colbac opened early and closed late. And the only time he saw a serving wench was when she brought him dinner. 
It was the adventurer's who had ruined it all. This had been such a nice town. Colbac had had such a nice store. But when a foul and black-hearted wizard had taken up residence in a nearby complex of underground caverns, things had started to turn. 

A wizard was bad enough, what with the destruction of crops, the mutilation of cattle, the disruption of weather patterns, the disappearance of virgins... a whole host and swarm of villainies were blamed on the nearby wizard. 

At first, Colbac suspected that the wizard might have been little more than a convenient scapegoat for the troubles of the simple-minded villagers. But as time passed, he realized that he had been wrong. Every Wizard worth his salt has a gimmick, you see. A signature theme to the magic that he does. Many great and powerful wizards have never amounted to much in the wizarding world because they could never find a proper of consistent theme for their oveure. 

For example, Venario, an enchanter who had installed himself in a tower far to the North, had found a theme in his strange and sinister sense of humor. He created some of the finest magical items the world had ever known, but the power and perfection of his enchantments were each directed into a completely counter-productive, ironic and often embarrassing purpose. 

It was not enough for the Great Giambanista Venario to cause a sword to be less likely to cut it's foe or an arrow to be less likely to find it's mark. God's no! That was the stuff of village witches. Merely parlor tricks compared to the great body of work that Venario had dedicated his life to enchanting. 

The new Wizard had taken an unusual and fairly destructive theme. He was a breeder, keeper and trainer of all kind of creatures. In his massive underground lair he kept a managerie of such variety and horror that, in the end, all the blame heaped on his name turned out to be deserve. Never let it be said, that Oddna didn't earn his terrible reputation.

But as bad as Oddna was, he was less damaging to the town than the plague of adventurers who descended upon it. They ruined the pleasant life in the otherwise quiet town. And they angered the wizard and his minons with their countless, pointless, hopeless forays into the Wizard's demesne. 

Angry minons, of course, lash out in greater and greater numbers for greater distances. Which, of course, calls forth bigger idiots who imagined themselves bigger heroes. The whole thing escalated in a vicious cycle until all of the outlying villages has been raised. 

Of course, the other townspeople didn't see it that way. They thought themselves beset upon by great an sinister forces. And those who came to aid the town in it's time of trial were great heroes. They were to be toasted, to be fete'd to be treated as the last great hope for the redemption of the town. No matter that what few virgins were left in the vicinity disappeared at an alarming rate. No matter that each party that set out, no matter how promising they seemed, they all met with slaughter. 

One night, deep in his cups, Borlag, the innkeeper had confided in him, "It's not like "

Colbac found the whole thing ghoulish. 

But of course that wasn't the real reason  <!-- Leave this as the hook for the story of the young girl. Colbac had once been a fighter, but he had been lamed by a  -->

And it didn't hurt that they were such a stimulus to the local economy. The Innkeeper, Borlag, grew fat and rich off his sale of fermented grain. He even changed the name of the place from "The Flaming Sparrow", to "The Adventurer's Inn". 

All of this was good for Colbac's business, but bad for his soul. Everyday he saw

As much as he hated them, they had been great for Colbac's business

<!-- 
Colbac had a special grudge against Venario, and knew his work better than anyone else in the kingdom. As the only outfitter for miles around, Colbac had outfitted every party of adventurers who had gone looking for glory, riches and trouble for as long as anyone could remember. Mostly, the adventurers found trouble. Even when they thought they had found riches. 
 -->

Halfway through his sandwich, the bell on the door rang, signifying that a customer had entered. Colbac grumbled through his dinner, washed it down with a swig of ale and mustered his signature brand of customer service.

"What do you want?" he demanded of the poor specimen who now clogged his showroom. 

"Please sir," the man in the cheap armor began.

Colbac held up a hand and said, "No."

"But you don't even know what I am going to ask."

"And I don't want to know. Do you see that?" He pointed at a sign on the wall that read, "No Discounts"

"I can't read..." said the young man, looking at the floor awkwardly.

"'Course not," said Colbac, "and why should you put the effort into acquiring such a useless skill?"

The young, almost-fighter ventured a half-smile. 

Colbac was not charmed. "I mean, wearing armor like that, you're life expectancy isn't long enough to finish a magazine, let alone a proper book."

"Pleas sir," the young fighter tried, attempting to make up with perseverance what he lacked in rhetorical skill. 

"Boy, go back to you your hovel," said Colbac.

"But, I need to borrow a sword, sir. Just for a day or so."

"BORROW? A SWORD!" Colbac said in such a voice as to make the strong, but poorly equipped young man flinch. 

"Y-y-y-yes sir. It's so I can rescue the love of my life."

"Oh well, that changes everything," said Colbac, as his face grew hard in the harsh light of his cheap torches. "Tell me more," he said, as if it was a dare.

"Well sir, she is a priestess of Dar. And, well,"

"Aren't they supposed to be virgins? Them priestesses of Dar."

The young man blushed and said, "WIt's more of a suggestion, than a rule, sir. If you know what I mean," his face grew serious, "but if it helps, I was a virgin, if you catch my drift."

"Help? How would that help?"

"She's gone and got herself into trouble. In the underkeep I mean. And if I had a sword, I could go and rescue her."

"Oh lad, if you had a sword, I'm sure you could. In fact, a big strong lad like yourself could probably manage it with your bare hands."

The boy looked shocked, "No sir, I could never..."

"Well, then, I suggest you find yourself another Priestess of the Eternal Flame of Questionable virtue."

"What are you saying. Look, if you are insulting the virtue of my young--"

Colbac slammed a club of knotty wood down upon his counter. "You'll WHAT?" he asked with great relish? Hoping the boy would do something stupid so that he could vent his spleen. 

In a quiet voice the lad said, "I'm not asking for a discount. It's just a loan."

"It's the worst kind of discount of all," shrieked Colbac, "It's a 100% discount."

"But I'd bring it back. Maybe with a few nicks, but definitely covered in glory."

"Oh Glory is it? That would enhance the retail value."

"Yes, yes," he said eagerly, unaware of the trap he was falling into. 

"Because you are such a great fighter."

"Yes, that's it."

"Powerful, strong," Colbac prompted.

"Yes."

"Well then, how about this?" Colbac slowly lifted the club off of his counter and held it above his head. He watched as the young "fighter's" trusting, cow-like eyes followed the weapons movement. Then, without the any hesitation of remorse or conscience, he dropped the heavy, burlwood shaft down on the top of his unarmored head. 
. 

As the lad collapsed to the floor unconscious, Colbac felt secure in the knowledge that he had done him a favor as well as a concussion. 

No, thought Colbac, you're no kind of fighter at all. Too earnest. Too willing to play by the rules. You won fights by cheating. And heroes cheated more than anybody. No, the young lad was better off unconscious, at least he wouldn't get his fool self killed by running off in the the dungeon. 

Colbac came out from behind his counter and dragged the boy into the middle of the street. Someone would drag him off to the Temple soon enough. And who knew, perhaps another pretty Priest or Priestess would take an interest (or pity) in him. 


As Colbac waddled back into his store with all the grace of a hermit crab claiming a new home. He turned in the door way and then glared out into the early evening, as if daring any other adventurer to darken his doorway. From across the dirt road he heard laughter from the inn. His face twisted into a scowl as he thought of them in there. The boastful and the proud. The pretty and the brave. The one's who thought they were heroes in the making, but would all, sooner or later, wind up in Colbac's shop, broken and broke, asking for money. 

Please sir, they would all say, just a little bit more for this amulet, can't yous see the magic in it. I just need a little more to pay a healer to deal with this salamander bite. 

Colbac slammed the door as hard as he could. The panes of glass in his shop window rattled perilously but they held. 


---

"Hullo!" said a rather dull-faced peasant boy who looked like he had been raised on a diet of oats and hard work. Innocence and honesty  did not make sense to Colbac, so he distrusted him immediately. 


---

Colbac was a shop keeper, but in a special kind of shop. You, of course, are accustomed to shops where the owner or the employees are eager to see you, willing to help and unfailingly polite. The maxim, "The Customer is Always Right" is never far from the modern storeclerk's mind. But Colbac had no employees. And his clientle was very, very different. 

If Colbac had gone in for slogans or clever sayings, if even the first business book had been made available to him, he would have had one phrase knitted on a sampler and hung on the wall next to the club that he kept in case of "customers" that wanted to "haggle" just a little too hard. 

In courtly cross-stitch it would have said, "The Customer is always trying to screw you, Colbac." Every time he had forgotten this maxim, he had lost money. And once, he had lost part of an ear and all the gold he had in his strongbox. Which, in a full accounting of things, wasn't all that much. Business was never that brisk, and Colbac had never been all that handsome of a man. At times he thought the loss of the ear might have actually improved his appearance. 

Although it had been many, many years since an Ogre had been seen in the Kingdom, Colbac would do in a pinch. In fact, as a schoolboy, the other children, in the cruel thoughtless way of young children, who imagine that they are invincible and no injury can last more than an afternoon, taunted him that he  had teased him that his mother had be

To look at Colbac you would, in your heart, no matter how hard you tried, give some credence to the vile slurs of schoolchildren. To being with, he was lame, nearly bald, stout of chest and round of belly and one eye was larger than another. If you did not have to make a deal with him you could have been fooled into thinking he was dull-witted. But, as a person engaged in commerce, this belief would cost you. 

You see, Colbac was not flee of foot, keen of eye or strong of thew. He had never won a fight

And, in a time when it was not unheard of for peasants to be conscripted just so they could be melted down into rendered fat for the cauldron's of hot oil that were dumped onto those besieging the castle, Colbac was deemed unfit for service. 

Where the was a need for pain and iron, Colbac was there. If you needed a thing, somehow Colbac knew a guy. And for a price, he could get it for you. The world was small enough, the professions were few enough and the cocktail parties rare enough that no one ever asked Colbac, "So, what do you do?" But if they had, he would have shown himself to be one of the few rare men who could  answer, "What do you need done?" and mean it. 


He had started small, with little more than a few rags he found on the corpse of a dead adventurer. These 


Adventurer's had been, as far back as anyone could remember, quite common. There were no shortages of ruins, dungeons and fallen cities in the Kingdom of Gygax, and each one was rumored to have it's great treasure, powerful artifact or beautiful princess in need of rescue.





Most of the other boys he had gone to school with were dead now. There had been, of course, the war with Thrace and the

Thief brings in a gem -- which is a message in a bottle.
She is trying to find him. 

Thief tries to kill him and take his stuff when he goes into the dungeon. 

He takes cursed stuff into the dungeon. Gives a cursed sword to somebody who wants to kill him. The guy is over encumbered and collapses to the ground. Colbac then takes his stuff and leaves him there crushed to the ground. -- at the end of the story he's still crushed to the ground. 


---


He gets the message and what? How much do you need to play up the beginning. 

He knows some regular customers, sure. They all come back in the story -- let's say three of them. 


Nattick -- thief -- brings jewel.

Blastum -- world's worst mage. 

Aurelius -- a real fighter?  

---

[you need to describe this guy]

Picks the gem up with a protective gauntlet -- you can never be too careful. He'd seen what cursed items could do to the unwary. All too well he remembered a man who came in with +4 gauntlets of self-abuse. Oh, sure, he had tried to pass them off as ordinary steel gauntlets. "Just try them on" he said -- but Colbac could see the dark circles under his eyes and read the strain on his face. He knew something was up. 

So he just kept him talking until the terrible nature of the gauntlets revealed themselves. And when they did, the man broke down crying and begged Colbac to help him. Colbact calmly asked if the man had anything to sell that wasn't of negative value. 

When the man said no, Colbac apologized and said he couldn't help him. He wasn't in the charity business. 

As they had this conversation, the metal gauntlets were pawing at the man's crotch. As he explained, with some embarrassment, any moment tha the wasn't actively using his hands, the gauntlets were having his way with him. He allowed that for some, say young boys in the first grasp of puberty, this might be seen as a positive enchantment. But the thing was, they never stopped. And they never let him sleep. 

He knew they were cursed because he could not take them off -- or unequip them as he said. 

Five days he had been trapped in these gauntlets. And he feared if he could not get them off that he would go insane.

Colbac face turned to stone, matchign the stone of his heart when he said, "I cannot help you."

Colbac thought of it now and was glad of every penny he had spent on magic nullifying gloves and curse detecting wands. He had never understood the logic or sanity of magic. How much better off the world of commerce would be without all of it. How much more regular and sane. Ah well, it was here, he thought and so he would arbitrage it as best he could. 

He placed the wand on it's hanger behind the counter. The he stripped off the gloves and placed them in the workbench drawer on the far side of the room. Only then did he return to the gem which remained sitting, defenseless as it were, on his appraisal counter. 

Colbac yawned as he straightened and tidyed his shop. There was little enough to look forward to. Mostly just a good night's sleep between now and tomorrow's work. Perhaps he could stomach the foolish adventurer's at the Tavern long enough to squeeze in a pint and a glance at Lorna's tits. 


It was gem, like any other gem and then it wasn't. He sneered as he watched Nattick go. Wishing, in his blacken'd shopkeepers heart that the door would hit him on the way out. But then he took his magic protective gauntlet off his hand

---

Once upon a time there was shop keeper named Colbac. 

Everyday he bought low and sold high and was generally a miserable heartless bastard who hated everyone and thought that people who went into dungeons were stupid. 

Until one day, a thief came along with a seemingly ordinary jewel. But when Colbac touched it, it turned out to be a telepathic appeal from the long-lost love of his life. The one who had left him so long ago. She reveals that she is trapped in the bottom of the Dungeon of the Crazed Overlord and begs Colbac to rescue her. She knows that she has done him wrong, but she also knows that the Overlord mows down strong men like so many blades of grass and that strength will not save her. She needs cunning and tenacity. And Colbac is the most cunning, ruthless and tenacious man she has ever known. 

Because of this Colbac gathers the creme of his goods (a lifetime of them) and heads into the dungeon.

He runs afoul of Nattick who (true to suspicions, tries to kill him as he goes into the dungeon.)

He meets a very tough enemy who doesn't want to bargain (first sub-boss) Let's him take the sword of encumbrance. 

After that word gets around -- he starts saying, take whatever you like. 

(maybe he goes and gets the gauntlets of self-abuse -- Ouch)

Creeping coins. 
Sword of encumberance.

"Yeah, well some day, I'm gonna be my own king. I'm going to get to the bottom of a that damn dungeon. Get that Amulet and then I'm gonna be the most powerful man in the kingom. Marry the princess, become the king!"

"After waiting a respectable amount of time for the current king to pass of natural causes, of course," Colbac said with a wink.

"Well, some causes are more natural than others, if you know what I mean," said Blastum the Almost-Mage.

"Treason! Sedition! Guards!"

And with that the  stone-faced guards came to life and seized the Mage. The young lad screamed and kicked and generally pitched a fit. His spells of little fire danced harmlessly along their chain mail, barely warming the skin. 

"Here, enough of that!" said one of the guards as he slammed a fist into his annoying prisoner. 

As Baltac watched the guards drag him from his shop, Blastum's face, contorted in pain, seemed to say "Maybe I should have been a healer."

When the door had closed, Colbac picked up the multi-faceted jewel and placed it in the display case. Yes, that would fetch a pretty penny. And now he would surely be able to sell it well above his cost. There were many negotiation strategies, and Colbac knew them all.

To his credit, he felt no pangs of remorse at having cause a relatively innocent man to be thrown in the King's Dark Dungeon. If he truly was the greatest Wizard of the Age, he would escape and if not, then it would be better for him to rot in the King's Dungeon than to get torn apart by some horrible monster.  

Besides, the only dangers in the world weren't in dungeons and it was high time the lad learned that.
