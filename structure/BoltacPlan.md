# Boltac Plan 

part one -- 

The kid he gives the sword too follows him.

Through Boltac defeats the Troll -- Make it seem like Boltac is going to fight -- honor and all that. But he uses trickery

part two -- Oddna (if that is his name.)

jump to him dealing with trouble in the Dungeons. Finally he posts the troll. All he really wants is to be left alone. 

Set up the bit about summoning the essence of magic to this world. Able to control it. To tap into the purest source.  

He has matured. First he made trinkets. Second he made life. Now he has gone to the source of all his power. It was a fine progression for a wizard. 

He has the innkeeper working for him. (I'm not going to have your children _- don't be rediculous. these are all my children. I made them.)
