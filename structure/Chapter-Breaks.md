# Chapter Breaks

## Boltac Runs the store

    Encounters, including

    Kid comes to "borrow" a sword

    Rattick sells a jewel ( a mind stone )

    Wealthy noblewoman's maid comes in -- turns out she's buying a small dagger for her nephew. Something seems strange -- need this quickly. Please, none of you chatter, my good man, just do it. 

        He checks her coins to see if they are creepers. 

## Goes for Dinner and a Pint

    Romance with Innkeeper. 
    Conversation with stranger {actually Oddna} (says he's a trader)
    Boltac spills the story of the ruin of the town. 

    The fight breaks out, "No, I'm the chosen one."

    Wizard says, If you'll excuse me.

    Well that one slipped", say Asarah. Boltac wasn't so sure. It looked like he had been poleaxed, but the little man had never touched him. 

    Boltac goes to get Dinner -- flirts with ______ She goes away and he talks a myserious stranger (Wearing sunglasses?) who turns out to be Oddna. They talk about how delicious the sandwiches are. 

    Some adventurers break up the tavern (in a fight over who is really the chosen one) Boltac gets the Innkeeper outside -- they call for the guard, but no guards come. 

    He consoles her -- let them fight it out -- then we will petition the Duke in the morning. stranger says, "What a shame it is. You have such a nice place here." And then he leaves -- on his way to the door a man tries to strike him but suddenly his back seizes up. 

    She comes in the morning and they have left. 

    She cries on his shoulder. (She's stronger than I am, thought Boltac, I cannot unburden my sorrows. The rules of youth stayed with him.)

## Petition Duke -- Orc's attack

    Adventurers have left without paying. "young and in search of glory," thinks Boltac, "What's beating the check compared with being late to saving the world?"

    Remembers the Duke granting him license to run the store. (hint at his younger misadventures)

    Something is wrong (guards are gone -- everybody is gone.)

     Boltac says he will go to the Duke (who no one has seen in some time) The Duke is gone, the secret passage is open obviously the household has beat a hasty retreat. What the fuck is going on?

     As he descends from the keep he sees the invading horde. Boltac calls the alarm. His spirit swells large -- he feels the blood pumping in his veins again -- he tries to run, but his lame leg trips him up. He falls in the street and rolls through the mud. 


    Orc's riding in on wolves. He puts up Boltac's bar of warding -- puts a magical seal across the door. But through the window, he sees he Orc's converge on the Inn -- Asarah!

    Grabs a sword from the sword stand (a cheap thing, heavy and ill-balanced) but a young voice inside him, said, "You'll not need more to dispatch a few Orc's"

    He opens the door -- slays one Orc, slays the next -- then he feels something tear in his chest -- it is the old wound -- and he drops the sword. An Orc is about to smash his head in with a club -- when his captain barks -- Let's go. Over his shoulder he carries Asarah

    She cries out, "Help! The mace comes down on Boltac's head -- "

    Darkness. He is awakened by the rain. He has wolf prints on his chest. He crawls across the way to his store. Uses his good arm to pull the cork out of a healing potion -- takes a long pull and surveys the wreckage of his store. 

    Bunch of shit has been stolen -- all the stuff in the display case -- the costume jewelry of weapons and armor. Someone tried to make off with the plate armor, but it was too heavy and they abandoned the task halfway through -- there are long drag marks in the floor. 

    Looks at the coin still trapped in the floorboards.  

    He bars the door -- even the rain is cannot pass the broken windows. 

## Rattick on the road

    "It was Rattick who had suggested that the adventurers leave without paying."

    Rattick guiding them on the road. Rattick knowing something of the world and how it works. Rattick feeding them to the troll. 

    The adventurer's complain -- fine says, Rattick, we will camp. 
    "Because we want to be rested for the adventurer ahead." Not that it will make a difference -- thought Rattick. Rested? For adventure? What were these children playing at. Adventure was a matter of being cold, hungry, tired on the verge of starvation and every so often  getting rich, getting the girl and being able to see and do things that few people ever get to do. 

    He feeds the adventurers to the Troll, collects their stuff and gets out. 

## On foot, quietly, with a bag over his shoulder and his cane at his side. 

    He walks off the road, moving as quietly as he can through the brush. After a day of walking, he finds a hot spring. Has the last mutton sandwich, rolls himself in a blanket and goes to sleep under the stars. He almost feels good, but then he remembers that night so long ago. 

    FLASHBACK -- the party under the stars around a fire grim Boltac, laughing, drinking, boasting. Vowing to defeat the PARLAC

    (Later it turns out that the PARLAC was Oddna's first creation -- a failure, but one that had a life of it's own.) Oddna killed all his friends -- then put a blight upon the land -- killing Boltac's parents. 

    Sleep -- nightmares

    Oddna posted a troll -- but he doesn't tell him the full story. Like a master liar, he tells just enough of the truth to get him off the hook. 

## Tale from Rattick's perspective

    Unto his deathbed Rattick swore that as he took his first steps back into the cave he had no expectation or knowledge of what would happen next. His only, as he would explain in all the thousands of times he told the tale, was whether or not the Troll had room for another course. He had never known a troll to become full, but

    "Now, shhhhhhh, his lair is up ahead and"

    "TROLL!"

    "What Why would you do that? You're crazy. You want to be a hero just like the rest of those idiots!" and Rattick ran away. A short distance, at the first bend, his curiousity got the best of him. Sticking to the shadows, he moved backwards to where he could get a good view. 

    He describes the fat man waddling forward, pulling a mace from his pack (seemingly too large to fit into the bag, but no matter) He hears the snuffled breathing of the troll. As if the creature had bushes growing in his nostrils. 

    Looks rediculous, a little man with a club in his hand facing a giant abomination of rock hard muscle held together by gristle and appetite. 

    The troll opened his maw and roared down at the fat merchant. Colbac was not fazed in the slighest. He flipped the Mace around and lofted towards the Troll handle first. The Troll thinks nothing of it and catches the mace. A moment later the Troll collapsed to the ground as if crushed by a great, invisible weight. 

     As it flew through the air, Rattick had just enough time to think, "What kind of idiot spots a Troll a weapon. Who does this man think he is. The second coming of the Great Shapoinon?"[^1]

    He watches Colbac waddle over and kneel down by the Troll's gigantic, misshapen head. He can hear that Colbac is speaking to the creature, but he cannot understand the words. The Troll moans something. 

    Rattick draws closer. "What are you asking him."



    They descend

## The Orcish ceremony

## Wandering Monster 

    Colbac is very heroic and leads them off after him. "Run, I'll draw the rest. "

    They get separated. 

    Rattick returns. With a gladness in his heart. Expresses gratitude.

    "You are my employee. I take care of those who work for me."

   
## Finds girl in Oddna's Court

    You shouldn't have come to rescue me. 

## Rattick Betrays him

    Taken before Oddna. 

## He tries to buy the Girl

    So he goes into the dungeon. The woman tries to get him to leave -- You've come to fight for my Honor. I thought you were smarter than that!"

    "No, I'm not here to fight for your honor. I'm here to buy you."

    "BUY ME! What do you think I am, some kind of whore!"

    "Keep your voice down," said Colbac, but by then it was too late. 

    Monsters sprung up from all corners of the room. The menagerie scuffled and howled as their master rose from his couch and waved light into the room with a wizarding gesture. 

    "What have we here? Why it is my fellow mutton lover. Tell me, what brings you to the depths of my lair."

    Colbac could see no percentage in lying. He jerked a thumb at [THE INNKEEPER] and said, "Her."

    "Oh really, is it true love?" asked Oddna with great relish. When they both blushed, he laughed. "Oh my, it _is_ true love. And I thought it was rarer than unicorns. But wait, no it can't be true love, because you told me you had no interest in her. Or don't you remember. I admit, I was in disguise, but I would think a sophisticated man of commerce, such as yourself, would remember."

    "I said she wasn't my _____, that doesn't give you liscense to steal her."

    "I don't care for being stolen, Roderick," said [the INNKEEPER]

    "Roderick?" asked Colbac with a snicker, "Well no wonder you've turned evil in your dotage. Was it all those children who taunted you in school that turned your heart to evil?"

    Oddna looked at him for a long time. Long enough for every creature in the room, except the strange, powerful wizard to grow uneasy. Mostly it was his smile. It seemed to grow and grow, stretch endlessly under those dead eyes. 

    "Yes, you are right. I have stolen her, fair and square, and she is mine. And you have come to fight for her. Take you pick of the creatures you see here before you. You may fight any one of them for her hand. Then, if you win, you may fight the rest of them. And then, if you defeat all of them, you may do battle with me."

    "No," began Colbac.

    "No? What do you mean no? You have come here as an adventurer -- as the Hero -- to rescue the damsel in distress. You must fight? You must. That's how these things work."

    "I'm not here for a fight. You stole her, fine, she is your property, but I thought perhaps we could make a a deal."

    "BUY ME!" protested Sarah, "is that your idea of chivalry. Buying the woman you love back from..."

    "I never said anything about Love or Chivalry," Colbac snapped in that way that you can only get angry about someone you really, really care about. "You know how many men have tried to defeat the great Oddna? You know how many have succeeded?"

    "None," said Oddna with a great swelling of pride. "I'm entirely too powerful to be defeated by any but the chosen one, if he even exists. And if he does exist, I'm sure he's not a short, grubby, lame merchant from the backwater town of Robrecht."

    "Yes, yes, mighty Oddna -- you are a rich, wise and powerful man. Quick to perceive your own advantage and capitalize on it. So I offer you a lucrative trade."

    Oddna's red eyes narrowed, "A trade you say, tell me more..."

    Colbac reached into his bag of holding and withdrew a large coin purse that he showed to be overflowing with gold. "I offer 100 gold pieces for the girl."

    "Girl?" Oddna snorted, "A handsome woman, certainly, but not a girl."

    "The offer stands, a 100," he hefted the purse and reconsidered, "A hundred and two gold pieces, for [THE INNKEEPER]"

    "But I have such a love of her mutton sandwiches. Crisp and fatty and delicious."

    "I cannot compel one so powerful as you to do anything, but my offer presents you with a clear choice -- mutton sandwiches, or the gold."

    "Oh that word. I cannot abide that word. Or. So harsh on the pallet, so cruel to the ear. I do not accept ors."

    Colbac nodded his head deeply in recognition. I understand Great Wizard. I understand. But all life is trade-offs. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Surely you understand this. The money or the girl."

    "No, I'll take the and."

    "And," asked Colbac.

    "And," asked [THE INNKEEPER]

    "Unh?" grunted the Orcs

## All is lost

    Boltac tells him not to open the bag with the gold. There are forces in there that are too powerful for you. 

    What? Let me tell you how powerful I am -- boast and brags. Source of all magic. 

    You see this smudge the Kolbolds are cleaning here. Yes that a retainer of mine who sought to channel that power. Burned him to a crisp, instantly." He kicked the giant oaken bucket and slopped water out on the poor, wretched creature scrubbing the floor. "Put your back into it, or I'll make your cousin's clean up a black spot that it you!"

    I have to be very careful -- what I do here, what I put through the portal has tremendous consequences for magic everywhere and at all times. If this flame goes out -- the portal between our world and the next -- the conduit through which the magical energy flows would be shut off. Magic itself might disappear!

    "Ah,"" said Colbac, "The antikathetiton,"

    "You know this arcane device?"

    "Yes, first attempted by Myglorg the One-eye, the great Orcist wizard of the Methorian age. I thought it was a myth."

    "So did I. But you can see my genius has brought it back to life. But how do you know of such things?"

    Explains about identifying magical items. Reading books in the Duke's library. Asking questions. 

    So, you can see that I am more powerful than any wizard that has ever been. 

    "Well, you've certainly got the ego for it," said Colbac with a smile. 

    "Alright, tear him from my misery -- "

    Colbac warns him again. And then he whistles. 

    Oddna, sends up a warding spell, very quickly then asks, "Was that all? I mean really, a whistle. Not even a spell of Darting Death. A teleportation? A magic missle. Nothing? Just a whistle?"

    "Just a whistle."

    "Ahk!" cried one of the Orcs. He beat

    Coins devour his minions. Chaos ensues. 

    "YOU!" thundered Oddna. He raised his hands and pointed his fingers, no doubt to cast some terrible spell. But quickly the finger spread in supplication. 

    Colbac hefting the bucket. 


## Rattick escaping, time to head to the South -- to warmer climes

Back to Rattick's POV -- he escapes with his gold. He heads high into the mountains to a little village where he has a girl (he ha a girl in every village)

He figures things have cooled down, so he'll head South with his gold, to the Kingdoms of the Sun -- enjoy the life of luxury to which he can easily become accustomed. 

He actually makes it there (medieval Miami) and he is hit over the back of the head. Thrown in the back of the wagon. (the fog blowing through the wagon windows would have given it away if nothing else.)

He's caught at the border and hauled before the King 

"Wash yourself, you are to appear before the King."

"King of Robrecht? Everybody knows Robrecht doesn't have a King." 

Ranger cuffs him and tells him to be quiet. 


## Colbac reveals what happened. He makes Rattick his minister. 

Colbac hires two legions of soliders

    "No Rattick, I don't want to trust you. I want you to try everything you possibly can. If I'm safe against my friends, I will be safe against my enemies."

    "My Lord, I am at your service."

    "And remove the sarcasm from your voice Rattick. I actually am a Lord now." He unfolded four sheets of paper. 

    He had gotten all the kingdoms to recognize him as king in return for a treaty that allied Robrecht 

    "You will go to war with everyone?"

    "No. We will be neutral."

    "Neutral," asked Rattick, "you mean as a ruse?"

    "No, I mean we will be neutral."


    And you are Lord Colbac?

    "No Rattick, I have adopted a new name consitutient with my new station in life. I am the first Lord Robrecht. Now kneel before me and accept your knighthood." 

    "Knighthood?"

    "Yes Rattick. What's the matter? You think Kings shouldn't have a sense of humor."

    "This is going to be a very different sort of kingdom, my liege," Rattick said without a hint of sarcasm."

    "Yes, Rattick, it is. There's no magic anymore, Rattick. Who knows where the progress will stop."

    "Progress is magic, my liege."

    "Well spoken, Rattick. I distrust your flattery, but well spoken."

    "You are right to do so, my liege."

    "Just so."

Rattick is stopped at the border. He is dragged before the King -- turns out to be Colbac

The Merchant Heroic. The Bourgeois Heroic. The Burgher Heroic.

## Rattick at the end. 

    At the end he asks the guard why he serves a merchant, oh, well me, when there's no fighting to be done, I serve gold. But when edge meet edge, I follow courage. 

    Courage, but he's a merchant, a particularly cunning and greedy one, who drives a hard bargain. 

    He's the King -- but before that he was a hero -- do you know what he did before he became a merchant -- saved blah blah blah.  


---

Oddna throws him into the land of misfit toys 



2. Adventurer's ruin everything. I'll go for the guard. They can't find the guard. Boltac says, let them sleep if off and we'll sort it out in the morning.
3. Boltac up early, looking for Shaftro, Captain of the Duke/King's guard. But the barracks are empty -- the castle gate is unmanned. Asarah comes to him crying -- the adventurers have left. Boltac says he will go to the Duke (who no one has seen in some time) The Duke is gone, the secret passage is open obviously the household has beat a hasty retreat. What the fuck is going on?
4.Rattick on the road with the party. Flashback to them hiring him. They talk tirelessly. Hiding from the Orc rush. Brings them into the dungeon. They get eaten by the Troll. (oh, yes, easily vanquished by the chosen one) They all rush forward. (Leave your packs, I will guard them) Rattick hides in the shadows. Then he goes forward to fork through the goo -- for now, he eats an apple he stole from the Inn.
5. Boltac completes a transaction, orcs attack, he stays in his shop at first, but then he sees them go for the Inn. He grabs a sword (old wound) and tries to save Asarah, but is knocked unconscious. He is awakened by the rain on his face. Grabs a healing potion, goes to bed and gives up. Passes out on the floor. In his heart he held to the secret hope that he might still be the fighter of his youth. But he realized that it was a dream.
6. The morning light someone comes to check on him. Pay what you want, Loot what you must sign is up. He's walking to adventure. That night he beds down and has a nightmare. He won't be fighting, he'll be peddling. Meets Rattick.
