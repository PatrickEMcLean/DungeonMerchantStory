SCENE: Boltac goes back for his sack	
POV: Boltac
SETTING: Sanctum



Orcs drop dead		

But Samga lives on in the darkness. There's a difference between being animated and being alive, don't you see?

Hey, what's behind this door? The one that crackled with a powerful magic field. He opened it up and it was filled to the brim with jewels and gold.

SCENE: Boltac goes back for his sack	
POV: Boltac
SETTING: Sanctum

Room full of orcs - They've all eaten his gold. They all wake up and start HORK HORK HORK. The wizard comes running. Asarah wakes up. KILL HIM! Wait, wait, wait, dont you want to hear my counter offer. Blows on the whistle. All the Orcs stop. Boltac, keeps blowing. Coins claw their way through them screeching and clicking	
Wizard tries to smite him. Boltac dodges. Trips over the kid. Kid groans. Half his guts on the floor, several of his limbs gnawed by orcs and he's still alive.  Grabs a glove. Bolt hits the glove and is negated. 	
Searching through the bag desperately, throwing everything and the kitchen sink out  until he gets teh wand. 	pity kid has to die. 


Wizard still blasting him. Muhahahaha!@	
Boltac's hand in searing pain from all the magic in the room. 	
OH, you're going to zap me with a wand?	
No, groaned boltac as he struggled to hold the vibrating, rapidly heating wand. Throws it at the font of all magic. 	
Boom, everybody knocked outward, then teh flame starts collapsing in on itself. Wizard is sucked in and disappears. Orcs collapse to the floor and dissolve into nothingness. 

	
Asarah goest to the fallen Boltac. 	What have you done?

Heh, I saved you?

But what have you done. 

That? Oh, I think I blew up his magic project. 

WHere's the kid? _- hE's over there, dead. 

Ehh, he's not all dead. He's mostly dead. We'll deal with him in a minute. Let me look at you. 

I... I... look awful. 

You look like a queen. 

"I what?" said Asarah. And then she didn't say anything else, because Boltac grabbed her and kissed her, just like a hero would. 


Everybody pays their way. 

It means nobody gets away with nutting' not on my watch. You want something, that's fine, you can have it, with precious little interference from me -- I'm good enough at being a King to get really involved you see, I leave the serious meddling to the professionals like you. Live and let live. 

"We will crush you, you peasant."

"Merchant. And exactly what are you going to crush me with there?"

"I have "


He knelt to kiss Boltac's ring in a show of fealty. Boltac wasn't wearing any rings. He held up his hand and shrugged. "Enneh, no ring. How about you just take this bag of gold and we shake on it?" 

The mercenary smiled and rose saying, "I like gold. It's sincere."



"But you are no King."

"You know that, and I know that, but nobody else does."

"But you are not descended from royal blood. The Gods will not suffer you to sit on a throne. You do not have the divine right... One simply cannot have a Kingdom without a King!"

"En-henh. Why not? Robrecht has had all kinds of noble Kings and Viceroys and tax collectors -- whooo have we ever had a power of those. And it hasn't done us much good. Maybe a King."

"A merchant cannot be King!"

"Why not?" asked Boltac. "A merchant can rescue the girl, defeat the evil wizard and save the land? Why can't a merchant be King."

"These things simply aren't done!"

"They are now. Have a nice walk back home on your royal feet there."




*Coming Soon: The Merchant King.*

SCENE: Boltac negotiates

They argue. The trap is sprung. Relan leaps in to defend him, but as he's drawing his sword, Rattick clubs him down. Asarah shrieks.

Boltac says, just the man I wanted to see. 

They negotiate

Why don't I just take all of it? 

I wouldn't do that if I were you --- some of those things in there are dangerous. Not what you want to be messing around with. 

But I am a mighty Wizard. 

Okay, so I'll repeat myself and say it again slower this time. Some of those things in there --

Enough, you grow tiresome.

SCENE: Underking

I should be dead.

"Someday, you will be," said the voice in the darkness. 

Is it magic?

No it is not magic, just one flawed creature caring for another.

The very end

En-henh. Battlemages? I'm just going out on a limb here. You're battlemages haven't really been coming through for you lately. Say, the last four or five days."

"They have informed me that the alignment of the spheres has not been favorable for the use of magic," Torvalds grumbled.



"En-henh. Is that one of them over there? Right there?" asked Boltac

He pointed at a man wearing a gigantic, awkward hat and dark robes embroidered with moons and stars and planets

"You, in the funny hat! Yeah, Jackass. I'm talking at you." When Boltac addressed the man with the phrase Jackass, all of the onlookers gasped in terror. One did not speak to Master BattleMage in such tones. Not even Torvalds, in his blackest moods, forgot his manners when dealing with such powerful men. 

"Oh, that got ya dander up, eh?" Boltac said, enjoying tweaking this guy a little more. "Well, strike me down. C'mon, lighting, fire and brimstone, pull a rabbit out of a hat and throw it at me, whatever ya got."

Boltac waddled over to the man in his dark, expensive robes. The BattleMage was red-faced and sputtering with rage. Several spectators turned away. But the Mage did nothing. Boltac reached up and knocked the hat off his head. It's fine, silk trimmed felt rolled in the dust and muck of the road. 

"MABADI!" he cried, jumping back and throwing his hands towards Boltac. Somewhere in the crowd a lady screamed. But nothing happened. The Battle Mage looked at his hands, hung his head and walked away. 

"En-henh. You got nothing!" said Boltac

"I, on the other hand, have an army," said Torvalds. 


----

I'm the conquering hero. 

"No you're not?" said Weeveston, "You're the merchant!"

It's easy to see how you would be bitter and deny my story. But everybody who hears that is just going to thing you are bigger losers than you already are. So go ahead. Cast aspersions, just makes me look better.
