## Counting the coins
Boltac gives the kid a sword and goes back to close the store. Takes the coin drawer into the back to coin the coins. One coins bites him. He chases it around. Captures it and places it with the others. 

Doesn't know what to do with them -- thought about trying to train them, but couldn't figure out the knack of it. Blows the whistle just to piss them off.  

Finds the coin that it bit. 


Nothing ever quite worked out the way he wanted it to. Was he any different than that poor stupid kid in front of the 

Oh he had wanted to be a hero. He had played with wooden swords and dreamed of glory. 

## Wizard Hears the Howl. ##


Watching Asarah, thinking of the fact that the city must soon burn. Perhaps he should take a leg of mutton to go. Or perhaps a sandwich. 

"Do you make sandwiches? You know, to go."

"Darlin', my sandwiches are so good, men have proposed to me just "

Outside, a wolf howled.

"What was that?" Asarah asked, concern flitting across her face. 

Her smile was nice, and sweeter for the fear that crossed it. Oh yes, thought the Wizard, he would definitely by taking something to go. "Two mutton sandwiches," he said with a smile.

"Lettuce and Tomato," asked Asarah?

"However you like them."

"You could, just enjoy the hospitality of my Inn and take fresh ones with you in the morning."

The Wizard smiled again. "But how do I know it will be here in the morning."


## Boltac, WTF ##

Sees a wolf go by. Hears screaming. He drops the coins in the chest -- next to the chest that contains the creeping coins.

Looks out the window, sees the white flash, and then another. and then a hunting horn?

Goes out front. See's fire to the North. Ah, said Boltac, Raiders. He knew this game. But he had thought the Duke of Robrechts garrison was stronger -- perhaps he could have just loosed his tax collector on them. Dar knew that they were fierce enough.Â 

Bars the door, grabs a crossbow another. Brings the stool over. Just let them come for his, Boltac thought grimly. They would pay for it. Oh, they would pay. 

Sees the Wizard across the square. Looks at the kid asleep on the bench. Nudges him with his toe. Doesn't wake up. Boltac thinks, some adventurer.  

Wizard blows a whistle. Lower pitched than the one that angered the coins, but a whistle all the same. "Hork, Hork, hork, hork." 

Henh, thinks Boltac from the safe end of his crossbow. Orcs. Rattick wasn't completely full of shit. He would have bet against that. 

Orcs ride up and dismount. 

Whistles, thought Boltac, he knew you tamed animals with whistles. 

He said something to them in a guttural language. They go inside. Two come outside carrying Asarah.

NO!

She screams, and the calculating, rational merchant was gone. His first bolt went wide. The second caught an Orc in the throat. A more cautious man, concerned with profit and loss, would have waited and seen what advantage might have come from reloading a crossbow. 

Boltac threw the bolt on the door and charged out with an axe. 

Kills another orc, trampled by a wolf. 

Boltac! screams Asarah

Grabs his leg an throws him into a building. Orc on the wolf laughs, but then the wolf collapses. The orc sees the bloodied dagger in Boltac's hand. Sees the rip across his mount's throat. 

Boltac crawls towards the Wizard. The Orc raised his pike above Boltac's head. "Hold!" commanded the Wizard. The Orc stayed the final blow. 

"My, my, my, but you are determined. You are something more than a merchant, I think." said the Wizard. Asarah struggled to get free of his grip and his attention shifted to her. "Come my dear, let me take you away from all of this."

"Let me go!" she cries, "I have to tend my Inn."

"Ah, yes," said the Wizard, taking his eyes off the broken storekeeper crawling towards him through the muck of the common square. He waved his hands and the front of the Bent Eelpout was engulfed in flame. 

Asarah screamed again. 

"Ouch," said the Wizard, ""that was my ear." To the Orc he said, "Continue." Then he gripped Asarah to his waist and flew up into the night with her. 

The Orc brought the Mace down on Boltac's back and he collapse to the ground. Boltac heard some of his ribs separate from his spine. He thought that was bad, until the orc kicked him in the ribs. His world went white with pain and he rolled onto his back. 

This was it. The Orc touched him gently on the nose with his mace and then lifted it high into the air for the coup de grace.

And then, in that final moment, he wasn't afraid, he wasn't angry. His last thought was of Asarah, and he was sad. Sad that he would never get to see her again. Sad that he would never again get to play the game of cheating her out of a pint, or drive her mad with 


At times like these, ordinary men try negotiating with death. I'll give you everything for my life. But Boltac was not an ordinary man. He didn't want life. He realized he would trade his fortune, but if he was haggling, he didn't want life. He wanted his life, with *her*.

As if in a dream, he saw two feet of steel emerge from the Orc's belly. The mace fell, not on Boltac's head, but next him on the muddy street. 


He wasn't afraid.

## Drinking a Healing Potion #


Gets a potion from a hidden compartment under the counter. As he pulls it out the wand under counter vibrates and he smells burning word. Most of what he sold were healing tonics, some of it was utter garbage, but this was the genuine article. A magic potion. One that could restore an addled pate, fill the veins with blood again and knit together knotted tendons. Boltac didn't know how it could be so, but, right now he didn't much care. 

He swallowed the whole thing in two gulps

He bellowed in pain as his kneed twisted back into place. Sweat poured from his face as he spiked a fever and broke it in less than a minute. A wave of nausea came, and then a sense of calm. 

He stood on his broken leg. It felt good. In fact, it felt better than it ever had.

"Are you okay?" asked the FarmBoy.

"En-henh."

"What are you going to do?"

Boltac thought hard. Set his jaw, narrowed his eyes and then passed out. 


## Goes to Duke ##


Are we going to go get them.

No, says Boltac, that's why I pay taxes.

But he took the woman you love. 

I'm a merchant, not a fighter. 

"You look like you did pretty well to me."

"That's only because you suck."


Suck or not, I'm going after that Wizard. Someone must do the right thing.

I tell you, that's why I pay taxes. 

You're a coward.

I'm a merchant -- Boltac said quietly. 

"Well why would anybody want to be that?" said the boy. "If the whole world was merchants, nobody would have saved your life."

"I'm grateful for that. Take what you like and then go to your death. I'm going to see the Duke."


Smoke hung thick in the air. And Boltac could feel his town keening from it wounds. From several hidden places on his walk 

Here an there, untended bodies lay in the gutter. 

Boltac shook his head and muttered, "Bad for business."


Goes to petition the duke. Expects a line -- a full court with those seeking redress -- at least the Ducal guard on full alert -- the wounded drinking by the stable telling stories of their bravery. A few orc head's on pikes, but there was nothing. 

The royal carriage was in the courtyard all alone. The whinny of horse echoed through the courtyard as he walked by. 

He pushed his way into the keep through the half-opened front door. No guards, no one. 

The Throne room was empty as well. What the hell had happened here? Sees a tapestry flapping in a wind that shouldn't be there. 

Goes to see a secret dock. discarded bits of clothing. A chest full of silks. He could see the scene as it happens. 

"No, woman, we don't have room for your damn silks." Piling the court in to stout boats and pushing out into the river Swift. After an uncomfortable ride through the rapids, it would be a leisurely ride to Shatnapur, the Northern most city in the southern kingdoms. 

At the first sign of real danger, the King had fled. 

He climbed back to the great hall. He looked around for a long time. Then he sat himself on the throne. Even as he did it, he knew he couldn't be serious about his irreverance. 

* Sits in the throne. 

* Chair isn't for him. 

* Never would be. You couldn't buy a kingdom/your way to being king

* You had to win it with a sword

* An illiterate barbarian could sooner be king than a fat merchant. 

* The health of a kingdom did not depend upon war, but upon quiet commerce -- everyone being able to do their business in peace each day. But yet warriors and their inbred descendants were the only people deemed fit to rule. -- Something was wrong with this system. 

## Boltac goes back to the store

Thinks about opening for business. Things about barricading for looter. Looks across the street and decides that there's only one thing to do. 


The kid took all the wrong things. And he took a pack. Idiot was probably walking. 

Boltac began to gather the finest items, from the most secret places in his store. Yes, it was stupid. But he could see nothing else to do. He would do a better job of outfitting himself. And he would be damned if he would would walk to his death. 

## Kid Hears the Wagon. ##


Boltac rides up and says, "Climb on, idiot."

"Where are you going?"

"You want to be the big hero? Save the girl, win the kingdom, all that?"

"Yes,"

"Well that's where I'm going."

"I warn you, you'll probably be killed."

"Me? But I'm young and strong. You're old and fat."

"Age and cunning will always beat youth and enthusiasm. You comin' or not?"

The kid still didn't climb onto the carriage. "What changed your mind. Don't you pay taxes."

"The Duke ran away. Took his guards with him."

The kids mouth dropped open. He lost the power of speech.

"Can he do that?"

"Age and cunning kid. So it's just us. Ain't nobody else."

The farm boy climbed up the wagon and they road off. 

{Kid picked a helmet that was too big, just because he thought it looked cool}
