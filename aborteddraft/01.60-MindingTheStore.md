# Chapter 1.6 Minding the store

In another part of the city. a shopkeeper was down on his hands and knees, preparing to do violence to his own floor. 

# Chapter 1 - The Bad Penny/A Plague of Heroes

Boltac decided, this was the day he was finally going to get that damned coin. He heaved his bulk off the stool, slid his dirk free of his sheathe, and grunted as he lowered himself to his hands and knees. His knees made explosive popping noises. Not for the first time today, he thought,"I'm old."

In what little light that penetrated beneath his thick, oaken shop counter, He could make out the copper coin gleaming at him from the gap in the floorboards where it had been lodged. 

He hadn't remembered dropping it. But as long as he could remember, it had been there. Likely it was back from when times were good. There were a lot more coins to drop back then. 

He had let it sit there for many years on the basis that tearing up his floor and having it repaired would cost more than one copper coin. A store was in the business of making money, and wasting good coin on a floor repair that a customer would never see didn't make good sense. 

Even though this was true, the coin had still worried Boltac. And in return, he had worried it. As he sat at his stool, or stood at the counter, conducting trade, he would rub the coin with his foot. As one might absent-mindedly tongue at a loose tooth until it came free.

But this coin never loosened in it's socket. If anything it seemed to be burrowing deeper and deeper into the floor. And years of obsessive rubbing had left the top of the coin as bright as if it had newly minted. 

If it was a constant reminder of what a profit was, and underscored that Boltac had not turned one for many years. Not since things had turned bad. 

He placed the point of the dirk into the grain close to the side of the coin. Of course, this would leave an unsightly tear in his otherwise pristine shop floor, but Boltac didn't care. Even though he didn't have the money it would take to fix it, he was sick of the penny's constant taunting. 

Even rubbing it had cost him money. Three times he had his boots resoled because he had worn out the right toe rubbing that damned penny. And he needed to get them resoled again, but things had gotten so bad, even the bootmaker had left town. A sad, yet succinct commentary on the state of the town of Robrecht.

Boltac didn't know what fresh disappointments the future would bring, but today, he would have his revenge. He raised the knife. He squinted as he took aim. He imagined the shock he would feel along his arm and the satisfying thud he would make as he dug out a chip of wood. 

But before he could deliver the coup de grace, he heard the front door open. 

"Nnnnngh," Boltac said with obvious disgust, "A customer."

He rose up from behind the counter, still clutching the knife. He tried, but failed in his effort to untwist the scowl on his face as he asked, "Can I help you... sir?" The only sincerity in whole display was in the knife. It was reassuringly and unambiguously sharp. 

Near the door, looking unsure of himself, was a young man with broad shoulders and an unruly mop of long, blonde hair. He stammered, "I, uh, uh, I" he said eyes locked on the knife. 

Boltac replaced the blade in his sheath, clapped his hands together as if to dispel evil spirits. He smiled with such effort it made his face hurt and tried again, "Welcome to Boltac's General Store and Dungeon Outfittery. We have everything that a strapping young adventurer like yourself could need to loot your way to fame and glory."

"We?" asked the lad, with the kind of farm-fresh innocence that comes from hard work, clean living and getting kicked in the head by livestock. 

"Yes, the Royal We, or, in this case, the Shopkeeper's We."

"But there is only one of you," said the lad, obviously confused.

"Yes, but," Boltac ground his molars together for a second. "I am very eager to help you. What do you need?"

"I am about to embark on an adventure of high purpose and consequence." With this last phrase, Boltac's hopes lifted. These fancy words sounded like coin. Perhaps this was the customer -- the one that would break the shadow of bad luck the store and city had been under. Perhaps, perhaps, he had money to spend after all.  

"Ah yes, well, you have come to the right place."

"I hope so, sir. As it is the only place in town."

"Yes, the Duke of Robrecht himself has granted me license to purvey. He has an eye to quality, his Dukeship does, and with his warrant of commerce he personally guarantees that this," he indicated his dark, dusty store with an expansive gesture of his hands, "Is the finest merchandise you can buy in town of Robrecht."

"But it's the only merchandise I can buy in the town of Robrecht."

"Yes, I see that you are a quick study," said Boltac, directing the young man through the shelves. "I invite you to direct your keen wit towards my wares. Here we have an assortment of torches and oil bearing devices. If you notice this one, with the curved blade on the handle -- particularly good when you are surprised coming around a corner.

"Here, of course, we have our major and minor healing potions. A must for any prudent adventurer. These potions are brewed by the finest Mercian apothecaries and brought in by mule train once a moon. 

"Armor, a 

"And of course, swords. There are, various schools of thoughts on weapons. Some prefer pikes, some care for bows, but I am a traditionalist. A good dagger on one hip, a good sword on the other, and there's not much a man isn't ready for. And this," Boltact said with hushed tones of awe

"Well, that's no trouble at all," he said, "we have a number of fine weapons, made by lesser known craftsmen -- most never tested, but the mores the glory when the blade becomes famous in your hand, eh?" Boltac swung and indicated the rack of sheathed blades that extended from ceiling to floor. 

Again the young man winced. "Uh, I'm afraid..."

Boltac's smile collapse in upon itself like the poorly constructed thing it was. He shuffled over to the door and kicked a barrel filled with swords -- some still bloody, all of them nicked, none of which had sheathes. "There's always our discount barrel."


{

i've been trying to save money to buy the sword, sir. Scrounging for herbs, seeing if anyone needs rats killed. But the countryside is bare for miles around... he trailed off 

And, thought Boltac, there's not a coin left among the good (or, more to the point, morally questionable folk of Robrect to pay for pest control -- and worse, any rat that dare show it's tail has been snatched up, cooked and eaten by any one of the horde of ill-prepared adventurers who have descended upon the land seeking fortune and glory. )

They died in droves. They died in hordes. They died on the roads. Some drank themselves to death. They came back horribly wounded or touched in the brain, cluttered the thoroughfare. 

The wizard, perhaps, was an evil -- but this was certainly a plague of heroes.

"I need to rent a sword," he said. 


"RENT A SWORD?" Boltac shouted. "Do you not see the sign?" he asked pointing at the sign which clearly read "All Sales Final."

"I can't read, sir."

"Oh, of course not."

"Please sir, it's so I can rescue the love of my life. She was taken, you see. By the evil wizard Oddna."

"Oh well, that changes everything," said Colbac, as his face grew hard. "Tell me more," he said, as if it was a dare.

"Well sir, she is a priestess of Dar. And, well,"

"Aren't they supposed to be virgins? Them priestesses of Dar."

The young man blushed and said, "It's more of a suggestion, than a rule, sir. If you know what I mean," his face grew serious, "but if it helps, I was a virgin, if you catch my drift."

"Help? How would that help?"

"She's gone and got herself into trouble. In the underkeep I mean. And if I had a sword, I could go and rescue her."

"Oh lad, if you had a sword, I'm sure you could. In fact, a big strong lad like yourself could probably manage it with your bare hands."

The boy looked shocked, "No sir, I could never..."

"Well, then, I suggest you find yourself another Priestess of the Eternal Flame of Questionable virtue."

"What are you saying? Look, if you are insulting the virtue of my young--"

Colbac slammed a club of knotty wood down upon his counter. "You'll WHAT?" he asked with great relish. He secretly hoping the boy would do something stupid so that he could vent his spleen. 

In a quiet voice the lad said, "I'm not asking for a discount. It's just a loan."

"It's the worst kind of discount of all," shrieked Colbac, "It's a 100% discount."

"But I'd bring it back. Maybe with a few nicks, but definitely covered in glory."

"Oh Glory is it? That would enhance the retail value."

"Yes, yes," he said eagerly, unaware of the trap he was falling into.

"Because you are such a great fighter."

"Yes, that's it."

"Powerful, strong," Colbac prompted.

"Yes."

"Well then, how about this?" Colbac slowly lifted the club off of his counter and held it above his head. He watched as the young "fighter's" trusting, cow-like eyes followed the weapons movement. Then, without the any hesitation of remorse or conscience, he dropped the heavy, burlwood shaft down on the top of his unarmored head. 
. 

As the lad collapsed to the floor unconscious, Colbac felt secure in the knowledge that he had done him a favor as well as a concussion. 

No, thought Colbac, you're no kind of fighter at all. Too earnest. Too willing to play by the rules. You won fights by cheating. And heroes cheated more than anybody. No, the young lad was better off unconscious, at least he wouldn't get his fool self killed by running off in the the dungeon. 

Colbac came out from behind his counter and dragged the boy outside. By the scruff of his neck. Colbac was not pretty, he was not graceful, but he was strong. He dragged the lad across the street and propped him up next to a drunk who was sitting on the bench in front of the Inn. Ah, what adventuring lies they would tell each other when they woke up.
