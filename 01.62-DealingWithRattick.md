As he gets to his shop, she thows them both out on their ear. Chosen one not strong enough to get defeat an Innkeeper -- what was the world coming to these days

Then Rattick, the thief comes into the shop. Just when he is going to have his ale in peace. 

Sipping his ale, surveying his wares. Loving his goods and lamenting that there are so few buyers. Oh in the days gone buy

But now just some seedy adventurer selling rope. 

"I have," said Rattick, "a magic item of great power, that I could be persuaded to sell you. But understand, I feel I am making a mistake parting with it. It's just," his smile looked like a wound that had become infected with teeth, "I have a sister in Blovatia, and she's terribly, terribly ill."

"Yes. I understand how hard that can be," said Colbac, "Having your only Sister taken hostage."

"Hmmm," he lied, "and with the illness and the strain of confinement I need money for the journey and for medicines and, of course for ransom. So loathe as I am to part with it, I must."

"It is a sad tale of woe you tell, brave adventurer," said Colbac, laying it on as thick has he could, "I am just happy that, humble merchant that I am, I have the means to purchase such a magnificent item, paying, of course, more than it is worth, because your sad tale of woe has moved me -- turned my heart of stone into flesh once more."

"Yeah," said Rattick, not quite comfortable with Colbac's sudden enthusiasm.

"So, shall I shower you in gold now, or can I see the item first?"

"Oh, right. Or course. I keeps it wrapped away for safekeeping."

"I'm sure you do."

Rattick reached into his pants, underneath his tremendous codpiece and retrieved a wad of dirty rags.

"Yes, I can see the value straight away," said Colbac. "My nostrils fairly burn with it.""

"Look you," snapped Rattick, no longer comfortable with being out bullshitted, "I come here in the interest of serious commerce. And you mock me."

It was all that Colbac could do not to continue the farce. He strained to make, "No, no, please. I am serious. Show me the item."

Rattick set the ball of rags on the counter and began to unwrap it with great caution. As layer after layer was peeled, back, Rattick became even more careful, to the point where he removed the last covering with his sizeable and much-sharpened dagger.  

This was Colbac's first clue that the item was magic, and quite probably cursed. For reasons more primal than profit (survival being the only thing that Colbac put above profit) Colbac was an expert on magical items. Or more correctly, he was an expert on Wizards.

Wizards, you see ran to themes. 

Gauntlets of self-abuse

<!-- Insert wizard bits. -->

"Well, what do you think?" Rattick demanded. Colbac said nothing. He backed away from what appeared to be a fist-sized ruby slowly, never taking his eyes off it. With one hand behind his back he opened the cabinet that held his most prized possession -- his gloves. 

The popular name for them were Gauntlets of Negation, but the name was inaccurate. The Gauntlets did not negate magic, put rather, were perfectly magic neutral. Like a lightning rod conducts magic away from a house, these gloves conducted magical energy away from the use. They remained totally neutral to the effect of any spell, charm, hex or incantation. 

For all there rarity and power (some even thought them not to exist) they looked like a gigantic pair of wool mittens. The kind that looked like they should be connected by a long strand of yarn to prevent them being lost or separated by an absent-minded or irresponsible child. 

As Colbac donned his gloves, Rattick eyed them greedily. They were easily worth several hundred times more than the jewel on the counter. Colbac could see the thought floating in the thief's eyeballs -- *if only I could steal them*. Colbac thought little of it. After all that's the exact kind of thought that should drift through a good thief's mind. But there was something else about his glance. Something that bothered Colbac.

"So, where'd you get this magnificent jewel then?"

"Oh, I, uh, that is to say, I prized it from the deepest depths of the Lair of the Mad Wizard, Oddna."

"You?"

"Yes, a brilliant bit of thievery, if I do say so myself."

Colbac's hand stopped inches above the jewel. The whole scene could have easily taken on an air of the absurd, if not for the obvious fear that both men had for the object on the counter. "You, yourself then?"

"Yes, the pride and prince of thieves I am."

"Oh, I can well see that," Colbac said with smile that got no farther than his lips. "But here's the thing. If I was a thief..."

"Oh, don't sell yourself short Gov, you should hear the things that are said about you around town."

"... if I was a thief, instead of just a man with a deep and abiding love for negotiation, I wouldn't waste my time or energy frittering around in some dungeon. I'd find myself a nice seat at the dungeon's entrance."

"You would," said Rattick, playing along as if every one of Boltac's words were cast from the purest fascination. 

"Then'd I'd sit there until the last survivor of a party of adventurers came along. Battered, bedraggled, probably half-dead --"

"Or three quarters dead, if you really want to save yourself the effort," Rattick offered.

Botlac nodded acknowledgment and continued, "Then'd I slip a knife in his kidney and go through his pockets for loose change and valuable magical items."

"You've got quite an active imagination there, Gov," said Rattick, looking more afraid than guilty.

"I'm sorry, did you say active or accurate."

"I said, active."

"Well," said Boltac, with a shark's smile, "It makes no difference to me, you see. I'm just a man who acquires useful and resalable items for the benefit of my customers."

"Yes, I can see that," Rattick said with great relief.

"So, tell me, this unfortunate man who bequeathed you this jewel with his dying breath."

"Ohhh, I like that one better. And it sounds so good when you tell it."

"What he in his right mind."

"Yes, yes, right and generous he was."

"Was he, perchance, muttering anything. Acting strange in any way."

"Come to think of it," Rattick said with a sheepish grin, "He was going on about some beautiful girl. And how he had to save her."

"Ah, I thought as much," said Colbac. "I will give you a gold piece for your accursed gem."

"Accursed gem. Why Gov. you wound me. You really, really do. Do you think I would pass off accursed merchandize to a man of your standing."

"Only if you thought you could get away with it."

"I cannot take so little. That's highway robbery, that's what that is."

"Yes, and you would know. If a gold piece isn't enough"

"5 gold." 

Then just collect your stone and go. Rattick's hand moved forward, then he checked himself. He knew what it was and he was loathe to touch it. One brush of a man's skin and the mindstone would posesses his thoughts utterly. Inserting desires and thoughts into it as one might inject poison into a sausage. 

No man would want such a fate. Even Colbac was wary of it ( as he was wary of all magical items. ) How much happier he would be if there were no magical items left in the world.





It was a mindstone. Anyone could see that.

As Colbac waddled back into his store with all the grace of a hermit crab claiming a new home. He turned in the door way and then glared out into the early evening, as if daring any other adventurer to darken his doorway. From across the dirt road he heard laughter from the inn. His face twisted into a scowl as he thought of them in there. The boastful and the proud. The pretty and the brave. The one's who thought they were heroes in the making, but would all, sooner or later, wind up in Colbac's shop, broken and broke, asking for money. 

Please sir, they would all say, just a little bit more for this amulet, can't yous see the magic in it. I just need a little more to pay a healer to deal with this salamander bite. 

Colbac slammed the door as hard as he could. The panes of glass in his shop window rattled perilously but they held. 

He rubbed his leg again. These were the last days of summer and already he could feel the Winter's storms approaching in his hip. He settled back onto his stool and had a sip of beer. 

For a while, he stared at the door, as if daring the world to send another customer. But then his gaze wandered around his shop. To Colbac, of course, it was nothing special. It was his home and his store room all rolled into one. But for those broke and struggling adventurers across the street, Colbac's shop seemed a treasure trove. 
Here were enchanted Mage Robes that were stronger than steel. Heavy plate armor that not even a dragon's breath could melt. There were weapons of every imaginable size and quality. But the finest (displayed in the magically sealed case behind the counter)

She is a high southron woman, of great breeding. Her dark skin wrapped in furs against the cold. 


1. Add the bits about magical items. 

One could never tell with Oddna

2. Woman from the castle comes by. He mentions that he must come to the tower of mists to peruse the library. 

"No wait! Don't touch that!"

"But it is so pretty," said the Lady-in-Waiting.

"Yes," Boltac said, slamming a hand in a heavy woolen gauntlet over the top of it to prevent the gentle woman from whatever God-awful thing the stone might be capable of, "but who knows what else it is."

"You mean," she asked in the hushed tones of one who has live their entire lives behind large stone walls protected by brave men, "it's magic?"

"Yes," said Boltac, "It is most certainly magic, but what kind I cannot say just yet."

"Black magic." she  in a nearly breathless whisper. 

"No, all magic is the same color -- and it's all bad, no matter how helpful it might seem at first. But this gem, I have not yet been able to identify. I fear shall need to visit the library in the Misty Tower, before I can know for sure. Tell me, how fares the Duke today?"

With this question, her fascination with the mystery of the jewel disappeared. A dark frown blew across her face and disappeared into the blue sky of courtly manners. "Yes, the Duke, he is... well. Making preparations."

Preparations, thought Boltac. When the Duke made preparations, it was almost always bad for business. But still
