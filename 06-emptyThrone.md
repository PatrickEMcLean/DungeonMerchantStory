Robrecht was a city that had grown up around a place of fortitude. It was one of the great paradoxes that a city that was seemingly in the middle of nowhere could be at the crossroads of everywhere. And while it was lonely and remote, it had always been plagued by raiders and bandits and generals at the head of armies on their way to conquer somewhere bigger and with more resources but who figured, "Eh, while we are here," we might as well soak up this little place. 

As a result, Robrecht had developed some very interesting coping mechanisms. First, the citizens had no illusions about kings or crowns or cults or any such thing. Their allegiance was to themselves and their neighbors. And against any tax collector of any shape or size anywhere. In fact, the Robrechtians (seldom, if ever called that due to the awkwardness of the term) were famous for their apparent poverty amid great wealth. They had it, for sure. 

As the citizens were realists, the city would allow itself be conquered at the drop of a hat. Only after the invading army had let down it's guard, installed it's local officials and had sent the soldiers away, would they commence to fighting. 

Some of the resistance was passive. Not so much a refusal to collect taxes, but a general incompetence at it. "I'm sorry Guv, there's been so many different people with their hands in the pot, I forget what gets taxed and what doesn't." And who could blame them. The average amount of time any one flag flew over the city was about five years. 

Some of the resistance, however, was active. And the design of the city itself seemed to support this. Winding, inconsistently named streets that folded back in upon themselves with neither rhyme nor reason. Brain a guardsmen with a paving stone and you disappear into the winding, misty streets before the watch knew what happened. In fact, if you weren't born and raised in this strange, bifurcated city, you stood virtually no chance of chasing down a native on foot. 
So it was that invading policeman grew fond of heavy helmets and tolerant of local customs. 

The city itself was split into two halves. In the distant, storied past, there had been two towns, Ro and Brecht. Each on it's own side of the deep chasm cut by the river Swift as it thundered down from the high mountains and into the capacious plains of the Southern Kingdoms. And while they were separated by the river, the were drawn together by the bridge. Or rather, bridges. 

You see, in the middle of the chasm there was an island of rock too hard to be washed away by the River Swift. For centuries the river had tried. And the battle between the seemingly impervious stone and the certainly unstoppable river had waged longer then the memory of man. At the center of the city was constant roaring noise and a cloud of mist. 

So a bridge was built from the east and bridge was built from the west. Initially, the inhabitants of Ro and Brecht only met in the middle to fight. Then to trade. Then, when faced with external mauraders

As Boltac walked the cobblestone streets from his store to the high, arching bridge, he could see a Tower rising from the cloud of mist.

So it was said that the City of Robrecht could only be truly sacked if the Tower of Mists was abandoned. As Boltac stood in the midst of an empty throne room. 



Boltac stood in an empty throne room. Actually, it was worse than empty, from all outward signs it had been hastily abandoned. 

The cushion was missing from the large walnut chair that served as, well throne, was perhaps too generous of a term. The chair in the raised place that let everyone else in the room know that the person who sat here was someone not to be trifled with. Someone who, no matter how small the Kingdom, or Dutchy (depending on the day) of Robrecht might appear to be to the casual observer 

Someone had even tried to take the ornate tapestry that covered the west wall of room. Most of it was a ripped off the wall and in hung by only a handful of attachment points. He imagined a poor servant, perhaps the last man out, scared out his his mind, the last man to flee, pulling frantically on a corner of the great tapestry. 

Perhaps he thought he could sell


Well, thought Boltac, th

But no one sat in the Seat. There was no justice in Robrecht. 




Yes, politics was always in flux in Robrecht. It was the only place Boltac had ever heard of that manage to be simultaneously at the middle of everything and a long way away from anywhere. But still, this was a bit much. 

So the Duke had run away, and his entire household with him. This boded not well for the smallfolk of Robrecht. Of course the Duke

"We deserve better than this," muttered Boltac. There was a whistling noise, and Boltac watched fog blow through the room and disappear into the tapestry.  

Hmm, thought Boltac, not failed theft, but rather failed deception. He brushed the remnant of Robrecht's heroic and probably false past aside to reveal a secret door set in the stone. The heavy stone door swung noislessly on well-crafted hinges with the movement of the air through. Only the torn tapestry had prevented it from closing. 

So that's where they went. He hadn't know that there had been a secret way out of the [misty tower.] A handy thing to to know. And an even handier thing to keep you yourself. 

For a moment, Boltac thought about descending. About leaving the whole mess behind him. Sure he would lose his inventory, but it wasn't like the store was selling much. On top of which, now that the Duke was gone, Boltac's monopoly was by no means a sure thing. Whether he wanted to go out of business or not, it looked like that would happen. 

But no. There might be a time to give up hope, but it was not yet. "Not yet," he said aloud to the empty room, as if trying to convince himself.
