As soon as Boltac exited the Inn, he cried out, "Watchman! Where is the Watch?" no answer came from the darkness of the street. It should be -- oh, what was his name -- that kid from Egretia, to the West. The one who always came in to pine over some bauble that he could not afford for some girl back home who had surely abandoned him the moment he left home to seek his fortune. Lad's these days, observed Boltac, they had no idea of how the world really worked. 

He started towards the gate, crying, "Watchman! Watchman," as he went. As he went, here and there curious faces poked out of windows at him. "Nothing to be concerned about, just a fight at the tavern." Most of the houses were empty, but such common folk as remained in Robrecht, nodded or closed the shutters or rolled their eyes before returning to their dinner. Good people, thought Boltac, who practicing a trade or a craft, worked to raise a family and just wanted to be left alone. 

They deserved better than the city's fate. This slow decent into disolution. 

In a few minutes, he reached the South Gate. When he saw that the walls were unguarded, he assumed they were in the guardhouse, sharing a bottle or dicing the long dull hours of the night's watch away. "Hullo the guardhouse," he cried. His voice echoed off the flagstones in the silence that followed. The gate was open. And unguarded. 

Boltac moved faster now. His step became lighter and his movements more sure. He threw open the door to the guardhouse. Inside things were a jumble. A few pieces of charcoal burned in the grate. The Duke's guard must have left within the hour. Two at most. Damnably odd. And... disturbing. 

Perhaps it was nothing, but Boltac closed and barred the gate. Moving the heavy timbers of the gate was a job for two or three men, but he bent to it and grunted as his feel slipped and scrabbled for purchase among the well-trod cobbles. The cords in his neck pulled tight, a vein in his forehead pulsed. Shoving as hard as he could, he got the hinges to admit a groan of defeat as the gate moved, inch by inch into the closed position. He shot the heavy bolt home, wishing for some reason, that he should go back and take the charm of shutting that protected his own store. Use what power he could to protect the city. 

Of course this was nonsense? Who would attack a poor city in the middle of nowhere? There was no profit in it. And if an army advanced on Robrecht, surely the prices of things would have gone up. There would have been spies, strangers passing through in odd rainment who... His thoughts leapt to Asarah and the man in black who sat at her bar and paid her compliments.

To go directly to the keep and warn the men there, or to go first to the Inn and warn Asarah. To save her? Ah, but she did not want saving, at least that's what she said. 

He turned and trudged up the hill towards the Keep and Tower that rose from the roaring gorge that split the town in two. As he climbed the steep and winding streets, his head grew light and he couldn't breathe fast enough. He felt old. As if the spring had gone out of his legs and the pillow out of his lungs. Too much standing behind a counter had made him soft, when once he had been young and ranging. As tireless as a hound and as quick as... well he had thought he was. Life had proved him wrong, in the end. 

He stopped at the bridge to catch his breath. The wood structure arched high over the deep gorge to the spire of rock beyond. It had been constructed by the same skilled craftsmen that chained the wooden roadways to the most precarious mountain defiles. Just wide enough for two wagons to pass, they were. Men and goods were often lost in the most difficult part of the passage. 

On the road, one didn't have much of a chance to notice, but here a man who was afraid of heights had time to see the whole thing. Upriver was the gigantic waterfall where Lake Halikai poured into the gorge to start the River Swift. Below, the river was lost in the clouds of roiling fog that gave the Tower of Mists it's name. The far off thunder of a mighty river pounding against the central spire of rock upon which the Tower walls rested, sounded far off doom, as one considered the empty air under the thin boards that made up the bridge. 

Perhaps these boards had been too long in the damp? Who knew which one had rotted away, and under which foot this disintegration would be revealed? Boltac would have been more reassured with a bridge of stone, but he recognized that for centuries, this jutting finger or rock in the middle of the river cut gorge had been the safety and stronghold of the the city of Robrecht. Invaders had looted and pillaged the city that lay on both the North and the South sides of the River the town, but no siege had ever been successful in crossing the gorge between. And if trouble come again, the bridges would be covered in pitch and set afire by the watch after the city had pulled back into the Tower. 

Or they would, if the Duke's guards had been there.

As Boltac walked the cobblestone streets from his store to the high, arching bridge, he could see a Tower rising from the cloud of mist. 

there had been two towns separated by the deep chasm that had been cut throughout the centuries by the River Swift


So it was said that the City of Robrecht could only be truly sacked if the Tower of Mists was abandoned. As Boltac stood in the midst of an empty throne room. 



Boltac stood in an empty throne room. Actually, it was worse than empty, from all outward signs it had been hastily abandoned. 

The cushion was missing from the large walnut chair that served as, well throne, was perhaps too generous of a term. The chair in the raised place that let everyone else in the room know that the person who sat here was someone not to be trifled with. Someone who, no matter how small the Kingdom, or Dutchy (depending on the day) of Robrecht might appear to be to the casual observer 

Someone had even tried to take the ornate tapestry that covered the west wall of room. Most of it was a ripped off the wall and in hung by only a handful of attachment points. He imagined a poor servant, perhaps the last man out, scared out his his mind, the last man to flee, pulling frantically on a corner of the great tapestry. 

Perhaps he thought he could sell


Well, thought Boltac, th

But no one sat in the Seat. There was no justice in Robrecht. 




Yes, politics was always in flux in Robrecht. It was the only place Boltac had ever heard of that manage to be simultaneously at the middle of everything and a long way away from anywhere. But still, this was a bit much. 

So the Duke had run away, and his entire household with him. This boded not well for the smallfolk of Robrecht. Of course the Duke

"We deserve better than this," muttered Boltac. There was a whistling noise, and Boltac watched fog blow through the room and disappear into the tapestry.  

Hmm, thought Boltac, not failed theft, but rather failed deception. He brushed the remnant of Robrecht's heroic and probably false past aside to reveal a secret door set in the stone. The heavy stone door swung noislessly on well-crafted hinges with the movement of the air through. Only the torn tapestry had prevented it from closing. 

So that's where they went. He hadn't know that there had been a secret way out of the [misty tower.] A handy thing to to know. And an even handier thing to keep you yourself. 

For a moment, Boltac thought about descending. About leaving the whole mess behind him. Sure he would lose his inventory, but it wasn't like the store was selling much. On top of which, now that the Duke was gone, Boltac's monopoly was by no means a sure thing. Whether he wanted to go out of business or not, it looked like that would happen. 

But no. There might be a time to give up hope, but it was not yet. "Not yet," he said aloud to the empty room, as if trying to convince himself.
