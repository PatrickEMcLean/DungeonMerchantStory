02.5-The-Party

---

He hung the swordbelt, scabbard and blade over the boys neck. In days gone by, he would have feared that someone might steal a sword from what looked like a drunk, but since the trade had dried up and gone away, 




It was technically, the Inn of the Bent Eelpout, but since there was only one Inn left across 



The door to the Inn banged shut. On the other side of it. 

Asarah knew they were trouble from the moment they walked in. 

It was in the slow hours of the afternoon. 

They had come in earlier in the day. 



Mephisto - Mage ** chosen one
Gwendolyn - Healer
Taran - Fighter ** chosen one
Alderbourg -- Ranger


"But I am the chosen one!" proclaimed the man in a mail shirt so cheap the rings were large enough to poke a sword through. 

"HOW DARE YOU!" shouted the man in the midnight blue Mage Robes, "You are merely a brute. A swinger of heavy implements. A bleeder of common blood. Chosen, perhaps, to carry my bags. But nothing more."

"C'mon, guys, calm down," said the bored looking man dressed in Lincoln Green. "We're all on the same side here." He was clearly a Ranger, and the only member of the party who had seen action

"Yes, please," implored the stocky woman who wore white and smelled of incense. "The true chosen one is has not been chosen to spread discord, but rather to spread concord and peace throughout the land."

"SHUT UP!" both of the "chosen ones" snapped at the healer. Who stuck her lower lip out and turned her offended sensibilities towards the wall so that no one could the tears welling up in her eyes. 

The mage looked on the fighter with disdain. "How dare you talk to her that way. She is a priestess in the Holy Order of..."

"But, but, but, you..."

"Yes, words fail you, often don't they. The blood that flows through your veins is coarse and common."

"Oh yeah," said the fighter as he grabbed the hilt of his sword and pulled, "And what kind of blood do you bleed? Chosen blood?"

"You dare to trifle with the great Mephisto!" shouted the Mage. He barked a word in the old speech and gestured with his hands. The fighter's half unsheathed sword froze in it's scabbard, and no matter how hard he pulled, he could not budge it another inch. 

"Oh, son of a whore. Now you are going to pay." The fighter advanced on the Mage meaning to tear him limb from limb with his bare hands. But he found that his right hand would not unwrap from the sword. With his right arm trapped across his body, he moved awkwardly and found it difficult to use his left hand. With his free arm, he lunged at the Mage.

The Mage dodged out of the way with a high-pitched laugh that sounded like the noise a small woodland creature would make when something unseemly was done to it. 

"You cannot defeat the chosen one," cried the Mage as he poured a tankard of ale over the fighter's head. "Peace, brothers, peace" cried the Healer, "We are all on the same side," she finished without much conviction. 

"SHUT UP!" They both cried, and then resumed their confrontation. 

In his flailing struggles to free his arm, the fighter tripped over a chair leg and knocked the entire contents into the healer's lap. Drenched in beer, and pinned against the sooty wall of the tavern, she reached her breaking point. She looked down upon her temple robes, the sign of her profession, great purity, devotion to the continued sustenance of all life on Earth and the obscene amount of time she spent keeping them clean and free of stains. They were covered with mutton grease, red wine, mead and the yeasty trails of the Inn's red Ale. 

"THAT'S IT!" She shrieked. The whole room froze.

He looks like he's about ready to ride his horse into a low-hanging tree. 

Oh those lot don't have horses. In fact, I'm a little bit worried about them having enough for the tab.

Cut them off then.

No, no, no, she said in a kind way that was largely inappropriate for an Innkeeper. 

Boltac heaved his bulk up out of the chair and took a firm grip on his walking stick, "Well, if you won't, then I'm happy to."

"No, sweet friend, I don't want any trouble."

"Trouble? From them?" asked Boltac 

For the first time, Asarah saw a glint in the merchant's eye that gave her pause. "No, please, I don't want to have to pay for the breakage," she said.

"Hmm," said Boltac, shrinking back into himself, "Makes sense. Have I ever told you about the coin in my floor?"

"Only every single time you come in here you sad..." she began, not unkindly, but was unable to finish because of a gigantic whooshing sound as the Mage lost control of his fireball spell and the far side of the common room was enveloped in flames. 

With a gigantic whoosh, the other side of the room went up in flames as the Mage lost control of his fireball spell. In his defense, he wasn't completely incompetent. His concentration had slipped because the healer had his him over the back of the head with a chair. 

"Oh dear," she said, as she watched the fire leap across the dry wood.  



----

Set up Boltac talking to the wizard. 

Have the wizard secretly cast a spell to quench the fire.

[when they face the troll, the mage tries the spell and it doesn't work. He and the fighter look at each other -- "It was supposed to work." 

"You're an asshole," said the fighter. Then the troll crushed him to the earth with one massive arm. The healer began screaming.
