# Rattick at Boltac's "Coronation"

> would it be good to set Boltac up with a pre-scene. Where he's afraid? Or can
> he just mention it here?

Rattick headed South and slipped into the back of the crowd. At the center of
all of them Boltac stood on a low table, waving his hands for quiet. "C'mon.
C'mon, shut up already," he cried.

"Why do you get to be King?" someone demanded. A good question thought Rattick.
Boltac, King, how rediculous would that be. But still, he had defeated the
Wizard somehow. Rattick had lived so long for two reasons. One, he had no
compunctions about killing, and two, he was cautious, cautious, cautious. If he
didn't understand it, he avoided it. And as he stood there watching a greedy fat
man make his appeal, he realized that there was something here he just didn't
understand.

It was not a feeling he was comfortable with, by any stretch of his dark and
twisted imagination. 

Boltac smiled at the man who had asked the question, "I'm glad you asked that
question. And, there are three reasons. One - 'Cause the treasury is bare. That
Sneaky bastard Weeveston either spend it all or took it with him when he left
like a thief in the night." Of course, Boltac meant this as an insult, but
Rattick found himself hoping that the former Duke had been shrewd enough to
hiest his own Kingdom. That would have been well-played and Rattick would have
to remember that trick, if ever he found himself in a similar position. 

"But if he took the money, why do you get to be King?" asked another anonymus
person in the crowd. Rattick didn't like to see what should be a typically surly
crowd treating Boltac with anything resembling deference. It disturbed his sense
of things. But still, that tingle of fear said, you never know who could wind up
being a King in these strange days in which they lived. Always best to error on
the side of caution. 

"Why? Cause I'm going to refill the treasury with my own money? Anybody else
want to do that?" The silence was deafening. "Okay, reason #2 why I should be your King, is
that, effective immediately, I'm cutting taxes," Boltac shook his head. It hurt
him to say the next words, but desperate times called for desperate measures,
"in half."

A general cheer went up, but the naturally skeptical Robrecht crowd still wasn't
totally with them. They had heard too many lies about taxes in their days.
Boltac didn't hesitiate.  

"And reason number three. At this very moment, the forces of the Mercian Empire, of
which we were so recently a protectorate, are on their way here now, to reclaim
us. By force, even if it's not necessary. Because that's the way people think
when they are part of an empire."

"But that's not a reason to make you King. That's a reason to surrender,"
said a fat man in front that Rattick was pretty sure was a baker. 

"En-henh. I'm not too sure that they are going to take 'Uncle' for an answer,
if you know what I'm saying. No, they're going to be plenty pissed and looking
for someone to blame. Why, if I know my Mercian tactics, they are going to come
stomping in here looking for someone to make an example of."

"Well, then the Orc's surely. They'll take it out on the Orc's."

"Yeah, but I told you, there ain't no more of those Horks. I took care of them."

Relan jumped up on the table next to Boltac. Rattick could see that before the
lad even opened his mouth that the crowd was ready to believe him. The thief
shook his head. You just couldn't fake that kind of innocence and naivete. If
Rattick could have done that, he would have been a much wealthier man by now. "I
can vouch for his story," said Relan, "I was there. And what's more, this man
saved my life." 

Boltac didn't waste the opportunity. "Anyone would done the same," said Boltac
with a level of false modesty that would take generations for another politician to
equal. "But the thing is, not finding any Orc's they're gonna say it was a hoax.
A revolt of some kind. And they are going to want to take out their frustration
by cracking some heads open. And since we've got the only heads here, well,
friends, something should be done."

Yeah, went up affirmative cries, something should be done. 

"So, anybody got a plan?" Boltac asked, in deadly earnest. 

"But you're supposed to have a plan. You're the King."

"Oh am I?" 

There was a grumbling in the crowd. Rattick thought Boltac was going to falter.
But he saw him look to a balcony high on the keep behind him. There, in the
sunlight and clean air, was Asarah, as raidient as spring. She smiled an waved
her palms in a motion that said 'keep calm.' 

Boltac turned back and smiled at the crowd, armed with new confidence. "So,
here's the deal. If I'm you're King, I have a plan. If any of *you* have a plan,
well then, you can put your own money in the treasury, face not only the wrath of the
most powerful empire in the Four Kingdoms, but also the ire of your
fellow-citizens... you know, come to think of it. I don't think I want this
after all." In a display of master showmanship, Boltac jumped off the table,
saying, "Nah, I'm taking my plan and going home."

"No, no, no!" rose the cries around him. The negotiation successfully concluded,
Boltac climbed back onto the table and smiled. 

"Okay, here's what we are going to do..." And Boltac told them the plan. 

And through all of it, Asarah beamed down on him like an angel. 
 
"Wait just a minute," said an old man, missing a few teeth said slowly. "If
you're to be King, don't you need a coronation first?"

"Maybe wait until after I've saved my new Kingdom, hunh?" Nobody argued. 

And that was that. The gig was up. Rattick went off to visit a lady friend of
his with reasonable rates before he left the doomed town of Robrecht to it's
fate.
