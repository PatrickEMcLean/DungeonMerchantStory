# **The Merchant Adventurer**

 # Chapter One: the Chosen Two 

"I'm the chosen one. Only I can bring peace and restore balance to the land," said the blonde Knight in Shiningâ„¢ Armor.

"You still don't understand," said the Ranger clad in mail. He hiked up his sleeve and showed a mark that was burned into his arm. "This symbol of the Cruel God Azaz, signifies,"

"Azaz my Az-ass! that your whore of a mother spilled bacon fat on you when you were a child. "

The two men drew swords and leapt to either side of the trail. But before either of them had a chance to swing, a thin man, dressed in faded black, stepped between them. Rattick said,  "Please my Lords, please, we mustn't fight among ourselves."

"Out of my way servant!" cried the Ranger, "It is my destiny to run him through."

"You don't have a destiny. I am the CHOSEN ONE!" shrieked the Knight.

"Perhaps," said Rattick, "You have both chosen." They stopped, swords frozen in space, to consider this possibility. "We go to face a mighty foe. A powerful wizard in a deep dungeon. Perhaps all the others have failed not because they didn't have a chosen one, but because they didn't have enough chosen ones."

"I AM THE CHOSEN ONE!" they both shouted.

Okay, thought Rattick, that was a mistake. Best to let the idiots fight it out. But before he could step off the field of idiocy so the battle could commence, the Enchantress chimed in, "Don't talk to him like that," she, "He is a member of this party. Moreover, the sacred vows I have taken at the Shrine of Lauranda, means that I must treat all beings with courtesy and respect. All things with respect, and eat nothing with a face," she intoned with an air of reverence.

Surprisingly, it worked. The men lowered their swords and apologized (apologized!) to each other. Rattick stared longingly at the Enchantress and the belt of gold rings that encircled her hips through the robe of white she wore. She was beautiful, perhaps there was a way... No. Better not to think of it. 

"Forgive me good Rattick," said the Knight, his head bowed slightly, "Though it is true that we have paid you to guide us to the lair of foul Oddna the Wizard, you have served us true and are a member of this party."

"We brave companions," said the Ranger, "we happy few, each, in our own way, fulfilling a mystical and wondrous destiny. Yes, we are all sorry to have used you so badly faithful Rattick."

Rattick stood there with his mouth hanging open. Could they be serious? Were they conning him rather than the other way around? With an effort of will, he snapped his mouth shut and pasted a smile across it. 

"Not at all, good sirs," said Rattick. "We are adventurers! Spirits run high with ones so bold as we." 

"Huzzah!" cried the Knight, as he lifted his heavy blade in the air. 

"Huzzah," cried the Ranger, clanging his blade against the man he was very recently going to fight to the death. 

"Huzzah," giggled the Enchantress, clapping her hands together and sending a tiny fireball up to dance against the blades.

"Christ Almighty," thought Rattick as he lifted his dagger in half-hearted salute.
 
                       *  *  *

"This is it," said Rattick.

"What do you mean?" said the Ranger, "You mean this? It's just a door in the side of a hill."

"You expected a sign?" asked Rattick. 

"Well, I... I don't know what I expected."

"Yes, that's why you hired me to guide you here."

"No good fellow," protested the Ranger, "Don't wound me like that. You are not hireling, but companion, member of our brave band."

"Yeah, yeah," said Rattick, "Let's get to it." He reached of the handle of the door, but before he could reach it the Enchantress interrupted. 

"A supplication. We must seek the supplication of Lauranda. Her blessing will keep us save during our time of trial." The Knight and the Ranger both drew their swords and knelt. Rattick rolled his eyes. Just get it over with. He didn't know how much more amateur hour he could take. But he consoled himself with the knowledge that it would all be over soon. 

                                    * * *

Rattick smiled when he heard the rumblings and gnashing of teeth from the darkness ahead of them. The Troll was still there and he sounded hungry. "Stay here, faithful companions," he said, playing it for all it is worth, "I will use my mastery of stealth and shadow to scout the way."

He handed his torch to the Ranger and disappeared into the darkness. As soon as he rounded the corner he stopped and squatted down in the passageway. Scout ahead. Faithful companions. What nonsense. Rattick wasn't sticking his neck out any farther than he had to. He waited a suitable amount of time. 

He returned the pool of torchlight. He donned an expression of fear and, with a skill long practiced, managed to tremble as he spoke. "It is a *Troll* my companions. A creature most large and fearsome. I fear it is more than we can defeat. We should turn back."

"Ha ha ha ha!" laughed the Knight, falling for it. "A Troll! That is nothing to a Knight of the Yarven Dawn."

"And it is even less to the blessed and Chosen of Azaz," said the Ranger, reaching for his sleeve. 

Rattick felt like he was going to throw up when he said, "You are so much braver and stronger than I?"

As he drew his sword, the Knight said, "Stay behind me and learn how it is done. Fear not Rattick, for you are in the company of heroes."

"I shall not let you steal the glory!" cried the Ranger as he shouldered the Knight aside. 

Rattick couldn't believe it. The idiots charged. A frontal assault on a Troll? They were so stupid he wondered how they had remembered to breathe on the trek in. 

The Enchantress edged passed him, smelling of exotic perfume. "I will see if I can bind the creature with The Mother's Embrace. Stay behind me and you will be safe."

They advanced through the corridor. There was a roar and the stench of something awful. Rattick new this to be Troll's breath. Nothing smells worse than rotting flesh trapped between teeth.

When she saw the troll the Enchantress raised her hands to cast a spell. As her hands began to weave an intricate the pattern,  Rattick slid his knife across her perfect, alabaster white throat. She gasped in horror as her life's blood ran down her neck and over the exquisite Ruby necklace she wore. Before she could make another sound, Rattick caught her gently and dragged her back into the darkness, away from the sounds of a Troll at play and two men at hazard. 

She looked up at Rattick and mouthed,  "Why?" Rattick tore necklace from her throat. Then he wiped the blood from it with a black silk handkerchief. In the distance, the screams of onto of the chosen one's ended in a terrible, squishy, bone-crunching noise.

"Why? Because it was a kindness? Because there are worse things in the depths of this dungeon than you can imagine? Because you chose to play a dangerous game? All of those are close enough, but if you really want the truth..."

He looked down from his glittering Ruby prize and saw that life had left her body. He knelt, and not without tenderness, closed her eyes with his finger tips. "Because I can."


# Fencing the Stone #

The Ruby Necklace danced across the oak counter like a living thing. Rattick nodded at the 

"Have you ever seen such exquisite workmanship?"

Boltac, the merchant on the other side of the counter, picked up the Ruby and looked at it closely. He gave Rattick a hard look as he licked his thumb, then turned his attention back to the necklace. He rubbed at the setting and muttered, "you missed a spot."

"Missed a spot?" asked Rattick as smooth as water over river rock. 

"Blood," Rattick, "There's some blood left on this necklace."

Rattick shrugged. "Probably mine. I try to use stealth, but the Orc I took it from put up quite a fight."

"En-henh," Boltac said as rubbed a hand across his shaved head, "Not that I want to know, but what is an Orc?"

"A fearsome new creature wreaking havoc on the good people of Robrecht."

"En-henh," said Boltac, not buying it, "And, you uh, count yourself among those good people?" 

"Of course. I am no mighty hero, like some, but I do the small part that I can."

"Okay, Rattick, I'm gonna make you an offer on your necklace here. The setting is crap, but the stone is very nice. But before I do, not for nuttin' but Orc's? You're shittin' me right?"

"Oh no, stout merchant, I assure you, Orc's are very real."

"Really? Kobolds, I heard of. Trolls, I heard of. Dragons, sure, but Orcs? C'mon. What does an Orc look like?"

"Gentle Merchant, I hope that you never see one, but I assure you, if you do, you will know it is an Orc."

"En-henh,"

"Let me tell you the fearsome tale of how I came to acquire this necklace and then perhaps you will understand the fearsome Orc..."

"You can spare me the story, Rattick," said Boltac.

"You don't enjoy tales of valor?" asked Rattick with a smile.

"Tales of Valor? No, I enjoy tales of profit."

"I don't know any sagas that involve tales of profit," said Rattick, "But tales of valor, of great daring... The bards sing many songs of those."

"Yeah, I don't really care for singing either. In fact, let's just cut all the bullshit. I'm pretty sure I know the true story how you got this."

"Yessssss," purred Rattick, running his finger over the Ruby, "but do you care?"

"Not if you'll take 15 gold for it I don't."

"15 gold, why I risked my neck for this!""

"You? I'm pretty sure you risked somebody else's neck for this particular bauble. Fine, 17 for the gem, and 2 gold for the rest of it." Boltac said, indicating the pile of equipment on the floor. 

"But this sword almost defeated a troll!"

"Yeah, and it almost doesn't have that huge nick in it. And why does everything in that pile smell like Troll shit?"

They haggled like this for a while, finally settling on 22 gold for the lot. As Rattick left his store, Boltac, muttered an curse and refrained from spitting on his own floor. 

He placed the Ruby in one of three lockboxes behind the counter and then dragged the bundle of equipment into the back to see how bad he had been taken. The sword was higher quality than he had hoped for, and there were a number of items that, while they wouldn't fetch top price, would provide good use. The odd piece of armor, some leather goods. He threw out a badly damaged boot was debating opening a non-descript fabric sack. Sacks could be trouble, then so could gems. 

He walked back out to the front. He reached under the counter and, after some effort, removed a heavy, brass-tipped magic wand from it's mounting  under the counter. He took the wand to the back and guided it carefully over all the items. 

The wand did not grow warm or shriek or vibrate or any one many colorful and destructive things the wand would do in the presence of magic. Strictly speaking it was not a magic wand, it was a magic detecting wand. Very rare, very expensive. But, for a man in dealing in items of unknown origins delivered by questionable sources, it was indispensable. 

"Ennh," grunted Boltac, more relieved than disappointed. Boltac hated magic. It wasn't just dangerous, it was also bad for business. When a customer can't try on a pair of gloves for fear that they would turn out to be MaGrief's Gauntlets of Self-Abuse, business suffered. 

That's why he kept the wand underneath the counter. Pick up a cursed Ruby Necklace and there was no telling what might happen. Before he had procured his wand, he had spend six months with a cursed Goblet of Thirst stuck to his hand. As annoying as that was, that wasn't the worst part of the curse. Put liquid, any liquid the in the Goblet and it would burn the hand that held it.

Just the memory of it caused him to rub the scarred flesh of his left hand. Magic, ugh. It seemed like it should be useful, but it's power always seemed to go awry. Maybe it was fate. Maybe it was karma. Maybe it was that Wizards enjoyed a particularly cruel and ironic brand of humor. Whatever it the reason was, Boltac was certain that theh world would be better off without magic. But there was nothing to be done about it. People may revile a merchant, but in the end, he can only sell what the buying public wants. 

When he heard the bell on the front door ring, he concealed the want in his sleeve and hurried to see what profit Fortune had seen fit to bring him. 


# Hitting the Kid With the Stick (Covered in Glory) #

Boltac found a strapping young farm boy staring at a rack of swords with an open mouth. The boy was so entranced by the cold and lethal steel on the wall that he didn't even look at Boltac when he entered the room. He replaced the magic detecting wand in it's hiding place then asked, "Can I help you?"

"I need a sword," said the farm boy, his eyes not leaving the weaponry. 

"Then you have come to right place. Welcome, my young friend, to Boltac's General Store and Dungeon Outfittery. We have everything that a strapping young adventurer like yourself could need to loot your way to fame and glory."

"We?" asked the lad, with the kind of  innocence that can only come from hard work, clean living and getting kicked in the head by livestock. 

"Yes, the Royal We, or, in this case, the Shopkeeper's We."

"But there is only one of you?"

"Yes, but I am so eager to help you, I will work as hard as two men. Now, what's the story who you gotta stab? Who you gonna loot?"

"No," said the FarmBoy handing his head in embarrassment, "It's  not like that. I don't want to loot anybody. I. I just have to rescue-- I mean, I am about to embark on an adventure of high purpose and consequence." With this last phrase, Boltac's hopes lifted. Maybe the kid was a little slow, but those fancy words sounded like money.

"My friend, you have come to the right place. High purpose and consequence is what we are all about at Boltac's. Why the Duke of Robrecht himself has granted me my license to purvey. He has an eye to quality, his Dukeship does, and his warrant of commerce he personally guarantees that this," he indicated his dark, dusty store with an expansive gesture of his hands, "Is the finest merchandise you can buy in town of Robrecht."

"But it's the only merchandise I can buy in the town of Robrecht."

"Yes, I see that you are a quick study," said Boltac, directing the young man through the shelves. "I invite you to direct your keen wit towards my wares. Here we have an assortment of torches and oil bearing devices. If you notice this one, with the curved blade on the handle -- particularly good if you are surprised coming around a corner.

"Here, of course, we have our major and minor healing potions. A must for any prudent adventurer. These potions are brewed by the finest Mercian apothecaries and brought in by mule train once a moon. "

"And here is the Armor. a must for all but barbarians and the most self-confident magic workers. You aren't a magic worker are you?"

""I don't think so," said the lad, a little overwhelmed by how fast this was all coming at him. 

"Perfect, then you have your choice of chain mail, splint mail, ring mail, plate mail, plate armor and  -- far less protection but the girls love it -- leather armor. Feel that? Very supple."

"But what I need is a sword."

"Maybe you do and maybe you don't. Keep an open mind for me. We've got Pikes, Bows, Warhammers, Battle Axes, Halberds, Flails, Morningstars, Maces and the largest selection of Fine Daggers this side of the mountains."

"I don't want a mace. I want a sword."

"Of course you do. And once again, Boltac's has you covered! We've got short swords, long swords, broadswords,  rapiers, cutlasses, sabers, scimitars, shishkas, and slabas -- and I did I mention the finest selection of Daggers of quality, this side of the mountains. While it's true that most of our blades have never been tested in battle, this is in keeping with  our philosophy of passing the savings and the glory on to you."

"Well, uh, I'm afraid."

"Afraid? A big strapping lad like you? Don't be ridiculous. Why, after you've been properly outfitted by Uncle Boltac,  you'll have nothing to fear in this world. You'll be able to take on a Dragon with one hand and an OwlBear with the other. And therein lies the value of quality equipment. "

"No, it's just that, I'm afraid that those beautiful swords," his eyes grew wide as he looked at them, "are all too expensive for me" 

"Don't be silly. At Boltac's we have equipment to fit every budget." Boltac kicked a bucket of swords next the counter. "Have a look at our discount bucket."

"This sword still has blood on it."

"That' s how you know that it works! A gold piece gets you the pick of the barrel."

"A gold piece?" said the lad, looking concerned. 

"Well," said Boltac, who was starting to get a very bad feeling about the entire transaction, "At Boltac's there's always room to negotiate. But try a few, see how you like the balance.
 
"I've been trying to save money to buy a sword, sir. Scrounging for herbs, seeing if anyone needs rats killed. But no one needs rats killed. And the countryside is bare for miles aroundâ€¦" He trailed off.

Boltac nodded understandingly. The only vermin that plagued Robrecht was an infestation of down-on-their luck adventurers. "I understand how it is. And how much have you been able to save?"

"Not enough, I'm afraid. So I was wondering if I could rent a sword."

"RENT A SWORD?" Boltac shouted. "Do you not see the sign?" he asked pointing at the sign which clearly read "All Sales Final."

"I can't read, sir."

"Oh, of course not."

"Please sir, it's so I can rescue the love of my life. She was taken, you see. By the evil wizard Oddna."

"Oh well, that changes everything," said Colbac, as his face grew hard. "Tell me more," he said, as if it was a dare.

"Well sir, she is a priestess of Dar. And, well,"

"Aren't they supposed to be virgins? The priestesses of Dar."

The young man blushed and said, "It's more of a suggestion, than a rule, sir. If you know what I mean," his face grew serious, "but if it helps, I was a virgin, if you catch my drift."

"Help? How would that help?"

"She's gone and got herself into trouble. I've gotten word from a friend that she's being held in a tower by an Evil Wizard."

"Yes, yes," said Boltac with, "And they are always *evil* wizards aren't they?"

"I knew you would understand. So, if I had a sword, I could go and rescue her. And there would probably be treasure after I defeated the Wizard. And I would give it all to you," 

Boltac winced a little under the onslaught of the boy's sincerity. "But just a sword? I mean, armor would help too?"

"Yes, it would, butâ€¦"

"And some healing potions, you know, just to be safe."

"Well, of course, but"

"And perhaps a flying steed. White, with large flapping wings."

"You have a flying steed," the boy asked in awe. 

"Even if I did, you couldn't afford it."

"But, we're talking about a loan."

"No, *you're* talking about a loan. You're gonna have to find yourself another Priestess of Eternally Questionable Virtue, kid."

"Well, then, I suggest you find yourself another Priestess of the Eternal Flame of Questionable Virtue."

"Look, I'm not asking for armor or a flying horse, I'm just asking to borrow a sword."

Boltac looked the boy dead in the eyes and said, "I'm not giving you any discounts."

""It's not a discount. It's a loan."

"It's the worst kind of discount of all. It's a 100% discount."

"But I'd bring it back. Maybe with a few nicks, but definitely covered in glory."

"Oh Glory is it? That would enhance the retail value."

"Yes, yes," he said eagerly, unaware of the trap he was falling into.

"Because you are such a great fighter."

"Yes, that's it."

"Powerful, strong," Colbac prompted.

"Yes."

"Ready for danger from any quarter."

"I might not look like much, sir, but I'll be a mighty hero yet."

"All you need is a sword? Is that right?"

"Yes, please, Sir. Please. Haven't you ever been young and in love."

Boltac's face soured. "I was never young."

"Look, kid, I'm not going to loan you a sword. But I do have an old mace I keep behind the counter, you know, in case of trouble. It's not much to look at, but it's always been lucky for me. I like to think it would be good luck to you. Would you like to see it?"

"Very much."

Boltac lifted the mace up from behind the counter. As Boltac raised the mace high in the air, the lad's trusting, cow-like eyes followed the weapons movement, studying every detail of the well-worn wood, wrapped leather handle, the business end studded with heavy iron nails. Boltac saw the lad move from disappointment to to hope. "Yes," his eyes seemed to say, "a mace. I could do it with a mace."

Boltac hit him right between the eyes. The lad collapsed on the floor, unconscious. 


# WIZARD v DUKE #

[^give the wizard some kind of tag so we know him when he talks to Boltac]:

In the center of Robrecht, there was a river. In the center of the river was an island occupied by a very damp castle. And in the very damp center of this very damp castle was  a Duke on a throne. 

The Duke yawned mightily, then thought the better of it. He was holding court, such as court was in the remote and unimpressive Dutchy of Robrech. There were no glittering courtiers, there were no ladies-in-waiting, there was just the Duke, an uncomfortable wooden chair and a long line of disputes that the Duke was supposed to settle before he would be allowed to go to his supper. 

"Messers Rudolph and Fuad, herders of goats!" the Chamberlain announced. The Duke waved his hand in acknowledgement and the men were brought before him.  

"He had advantage of my goat, sire. And I desire compensation," said the cross-eyed man said as he cast a terrible glare in the approximate direction of the man next to him. The Duke turned his gaze at the accused, a man who was wearing a goat-skin helmet. Was the helmet this man's idea of formal dress, the Duke wondered? The Duke opened his mouth as if to speak, but then thought better of it. 

The pause stretched to a such a length that the Chamberlain gently prompted, "Sire?"

"Advantage?" asked the Duke, unable, with his formal, courtly upbringing, to understand how having a goat might be an advantage. It's not that there were no goats in the Mercian Empire. It's that he had been insulated from all creatures that were shaggy and uncultured from the time he had left the womb.

"He had knowledge of my best NannyGoat."

"Knowledge? I don't understand, of course he has knowledge of your animal," he said, glancing at the dull-eyed, leather-helmeted man who was being accuse of bestiality, "he is a fellow-goatherd, is he not."

"No my lord," said the cross-eyed man, blushing with the weight of what he must now make painfully obvious. "He..." and he thrust his pelvis forward and backwards in an unmistakeable, rhythmic motion. 

"Oh. Oh? OH!" said the Duke, as facts of the case came into focus for him. "Really. What was it like?" asked the Duke.

The Chamberlain began to cough. This was a pre-arranged signal between the two that the Duke was wandering dangerously off course. The Chamberlain did a lot of coughing. 

"Very well," the Duke said, "I command you to violate one of his sheep."

"WHAT!"

"Yes, yes, my good man, that is justice. He has had one of yours, so you must have one of his. An eye for an eye and a ewe for a ewe, you see." The Duke said, feeling awfully proud of himself. But by the look on the goatherd's face, he could see that his legal acumen was lost on the man. 

The Chamberlain continued to cough. The Duke became worried about how might talk his way out of his ruling without seemingly he he was contradicting himself. The Duke, was aware of, vaguely, that he was not the sharpest arrow in the quiver. But he was straight on one point: The only mortal sin a person in power might truly commit was seeming to contradict themselves. 

He couldn't understand where he had gone wrong? What taboo had he crossed. It was a perfectly logical verdict. He was a perfectly logical ruler. And why did ruler's have to explain themselves to their subjects anyway? Maybe it was just Dukes. He was pretty sure if he was a King he wouldn't have had to explain himself to anyone. 

Just has he was thinking that, a Wizard appeared in the great hall. And this is not to say he made an entrance. One minute there was an empty space on the cold stone floor and the next, there he stood. Shaven Pate, black robes dark circles under his eyes, strange stains underneath his fingertips -- one moment he wasn't there, and the next, he was. The Wizard Appeared.  

There was a gasp as those in the great hall,  jumped back from the man who had appeared in their midst. Nonplussed, the Chamberlain said, "A man appearing from nowhere!" 

The Wizard looked at the Chamberlain sharply and hissed, "My name is Almont Dimsbury."

"Dimsbury, A wizard of considerable evil," the Chamberlain said. But the wizard's look darkened and more imaginative people in the crowd would later swear that they saw flames forming deep in the Wizard's pupils. 

"â€¦who's reputation is much maligned," the Chamberlain added diplomatically. 

"Yes, enough, that's quite enough" said the Duke. "Wizard's, you will simply have to wait your turn."

"Oh," said the Wizard. "I hope this isn't convenient for you. I *am* sorry. Pray, continue with your amusements. My time is of little consequence." He punctuated his sentence with a wave of his hand that turned the cross-eyed goatherd in a rather lovely-looking brown and white nanny goat. This time, even the Chamberlain gasped in fear. 

Fuad, the Goatherd in the leather helmet, smiled at the newly-minted goat with an unwholesome gleam in his eye. As he rubbed his hand along the length of rope that held up his trousers, the Nanny goat gave up a fearful bleat.

The Wizard said, "Please, don't let me interrupt."

No one spoke. The only sound was the clacks of the goat's hooves as she/he wisely made for the exit as fast as her/his terribly confused legs would carry her.

Exasperated that the still crowd wasn't getting the point, the Wizard said, "What does it take? Must I strike all of you down with a pillar of flame? Gah. Let me outline it for you.  I am a *horrible* man. Dimsbury the terrible. Master of the arcane arts and elder mysteries, summoner of demons, so on and so forth, so GIVE ME THE ROOM. Now, go. Flee."

And so they did. And when the oaken door slammed behind them, the Wizard and the Duke were the only people left in the room. 

"There," said the Wizard, "That's better."

"Hullo, Almont, enjoying yourself?"

"Quite Weevston. You know how I do like to make an entrance."

"I apologize for my subjects," said the Duke, "they are a bit... provincial."

"Thick is the word I would have used."

"Would you care for some wine," asked the Duke as he draped his leg over the side of his chair and slumped with the false exhaustion that only comes with never having worked a day in your life.

"I want you to *get out*," said the Wizard.

"Excuse me?"

"I said, get out. Abdicate. Leave this place. And take everyone with you."

"I wish that I could," said the Duke, "I never wanted to come to this damp, grey place to begin with."

"Ah, well there you go," the Wizard, "I love it when things are easy. Did you say there was wine?"

"Sadly," said the Duke.

"Sadly? I thought you said there was wine."

"Oh wine? We've got it by the barrelful. And by the bottleful in cabinet over there. Since you've run off all my servants, subjects and goat herders, I suggest you help yourself. All told this tower and keep contains more wine than I could drink in three lifetimes. Although the prospect of staying here for three lifetimes," the Duke chuckled as he made a slicing motion across his throat."

"I don't think you understand," said the Wizard, trying to be reasonable, "this is a courtesy call. What I mean to say is that this request is for your benefit, not mine."

"Steady on, old boy," said the Duke. "I'm on your side. I'm ready to do as you command. You want this kingdom -- well this dismal little duchy -- I say you can have it. Good riddance to fickle mountain weather, thick-ankled peasant girls and goat violators of every shape and stripe. But, here's the thing, I can't. The minute I leave my post, my family will know of it. In particular my Uncle Torvald, do you know my Uncle Torvald?"

"Can't say I have had the pleasure," said Oddna, fighting back an urge to engulf the Duke in flames with a clap of his hands. 

"I have the burden of carrying a great name. Weaveeston Prestidigitous RampartLion Toroble the 15th, in fact. And this name means that I am not free do what I would like. I am not free to marry who I like. I am not free to live where I like. I have been sent here. And if I abdicate, Torvald Toroble will have me killed. Either by assassin or generalship of an army on it's way to a glorious lost cause or perhaps just with a good old-fashioned hunting accident."

"How do you know?" asked Wizard, still trying to reason with him. 

"It's how he did my father. Hunting "accident. And when dear old Dad survived that, then Torvalds sent his very own doctor to poison the man."

"Damn it, man," cried Almont, "I'm trying very hard not to be the stereotypical Evil Wizard. But you're just not helping.  I don't want to be a stereotype. Don't make me be a stereotype."

"I never suggested that you were," said the Duke, with a look of care on his face.

"I could have swept in from the East and just taken that mine and cavern system for myself. Killed all the miners, released horrible creatures into the countryside. Right? Could have done that, couldn't I?"

"Yes, you could have, but I don't feel that you are the kind of --"

"But instead, I bought that mine. Paid gold on the barrel head for it. Didn't I?"

"You did. Please, Almont, what has gotten into you? You are a fine neighbor." said the Duke, trying to tell this powerful and somewhat crazed man what he wanted to hear. 

"Yes, I am," the Wizard said, calming enough to take a healthy gulp of wine. "I am a fine neighbor, but you, and I mean the royal you, Duke Robrecht, are not."

"Ugh, Robrecht as a name. Why it sounds simply ghastly, doesn't it."

"Your subject are the ghastly bits. Those little people who infest this land. With their grubbing in the dirt and milking of animals."

"Ah, taxpayers," said the Duke, "Yes, my Uncle says I am here to farm them."

"Herd them? Wouldn't herd be the word you're looking for?"

"Yes, I suppose it would. I am to herd them until tax time. And then I shear them and release them back into their fields."

"Look, dear man, it's not your sheep that are the problem. Nor your goats. The problem is the relents press of adventurers seeking to steal what they imagine is the vast repository of treasure stashed in my dungeon."

"You have treasure, Almont? All this time you've been holding out on me?"

"No, no, heavens no. I mean a little *family* money, but nothing to speak of. I am a Wizard, a researcher into the arcane and terrible forces that undergird all of our lives."

"Sounds rather dull to me."

"Well, it's not for everyone, but my work is *important*. Deucedly important. So much so that I've nearly isolated the source of all magic in this plane of existence."

"Plane of existence?" asked the Duke, wrinkling his face in confusion.

"Sorry, sorry, don't mean to trouble you with technical terms. The thing is, If I can harness this source, tap into the very essence, why I would be the most powerful and accomplished Mage in the history of the world."

"Prize for that is there?"

"No, Weeveston, there is not. Power is it's own reward."

"Ah, yes, well, you'd have to talk to my Uncle about that."

"But not on a hunting trip?"

"Oh, ho ho, quite so. Quite so."

"The point is, I keep getting interrupted in my work. I can't get anything done. And it's your fault."

"My fault?"

"Yes, the endless stream of mendicants, adventurers and ne'er do wells who seek to kill me and deprive me of property. To become rich heroes by defeating the Evil Wizard, that's what they want!" Here the Wizard grew less sure of himself, "I'm not an *evil* wizard, am I Weeaveston? I try not to be, but some days, God I just don't know."

"No, of course you are not an Evil Wizard. I've known you since grammar school. A touch mischievous, perhaps. But Evil? No."

""Oh, thank you for saying so. I do appreciate your honesty," said the Wizard. ""At first I though the adventurers would stop coming. You know, after most of the first wave of looters fell into my traps or afoul of my pets. But failure dissuaded no one. They doubled their efforts. And then redoubled them after that!

"Most died on the upper levels, but the few that managed to penetrate deeper into my stronghold, they've caused real damage. So I have been force to turn away from my important work to employ spies and turncoats,  fashion ever more diabolical traps and oversee the painful logistics of force management and deployment. I don't want any of this, it's a constant strain and a distraction from my work. I tell you Weaveeston, I am close to a deeper knowledge an understanding of the forces that shape our world than any man has ever had before."

The Duke fixed the Wizard with a look and said, "I know what force shapes our world, and sadly, it is heredity."

But the Wizard was on a roll. "And the power! The limitless power. It should be I that make this connection with the source. Lest this power fall in to the hands of some EVIL wizard. So I'm afraid you simply must go. There's no other way I can see it."

"I would like nothing better than to comply with your wishes, old friend. But my Uncle would have me killed. Even if I did leave, it would do you no good, he would come in force and just take the Kingdom back. And it's not like it would solve your problem. I mean I can't very well take the sheep with me. Or stop members of the herd from seeking you out and troubling your in your research."

 "Yes, Weeveston, I suppose your right. I just -- you know, the long hours of study, the feeling of limitless power at one's finger tips. I just thought there must be some way to solve this problem."

"Of course, old boy. Perfectly understandable. Perhaps I could lend you some of my guards, to help ease the burden. But heavens knows my Uncle leaves me precious little enough to staff an army. Really more of a garrison. A bunch of drunks in helmets, honestly."

"Yes, I know, we all have our problems. I'm sorry Weeveston, I've been an ass. I've barged in unannounced, I've hit your man with Tilhphad's spell of Transformation. Threatened you with ultimatums. I swear Weaveeston, on my mother's grave, the soil of which is indispensable for the making of certain potions, I never wanted to be an Evil Wizard. A screeching, fire-throwing caricature of myself. But the world... the world will simply drive a man to it."

"Ah, hmm, yes." said the Duke. "You should meet my Aunt Etheline."

"Torvalds' wife?"

"Oh no, he had her killed long ago. Needlepoint accident. He has something of a penchant for killing relatives. No Etheline is his sister. And compared to him she is the *ruthless* one."

"Well, that makes me feel better."

"Better?"

"Yes, I would never do such a thing to my own family."

"Your extended family doesn't own and fight over estates and dominions that cover nearly a third of the known world."

"Perhaps you have a point. But *I* would draw the line at assassinating my own family."

"I do as well," said the Duke with an air of resignation, "But only because I don't have the means or talent to get away with it." 

"Oh and I should mention, I've dispatched a raiding party."

"Raiding party, well that doesn't sound so bad, fit of temper and all. "

"Of Orcs,"

"Orcs? What are those?"

"They ride wolves, Weeveston. Wolves."

"Well whatever they are, they can't be very large if they are riding wolves."

"They are very large wolves."

"Yes, but what is a Horc?"

"No, no, good fellow, an Orc. No 'h'. They are my latest work. Terrible, terribly murderously bloodthirsty creatures. Stronger and faster than a man. Some cultivars have tusks, other do not. They all have greyish-green skin, almost impervious to weapons -- if not for the constant interruptions I would have gotten that right.

Look, it's important that you know how badly I feel about this. Wiping out your entire Kingdom--" at the sound of the world Kingdom, the Duke flinched. "Oh, sorry, sorry, Duchy. Very sorry about that, didn't mean to rub it in.

Look, I feel terrible about all of this old boy, really I do. but it seems the only way to get the peace in which I need to work."

"Well, I understand, you were upset, it's just a raiding party. Probably do the old town some good. A little raiding. Till up the soil, attract more adventurer's. Defend good ol' Robrecht."

"No, no that's not the point. You see, old boy, I mean to drive you out. Work salt into the earth so nothing will ever grow here again."


"Wait, how many people in the raiding party. I mean how many of these Horks?"

"Orcs"

"â€¦do you have?"

"Oh, a few thousand, by now I should say!"

"oh, well, why didn't you say so?"

"what difference does it make?"

"well if it two dozen our so, it would be a mere raiding party. But a thousand, perhaps two. Yes, two thousand?"

"I'm a wizard," said the Wizard, "Just not with numbers."

"Well, a quick look at the treasury will reveal that neither am I. But, anything over 500 is clearly an army."

"So,"

"Well, I wouldn't have abdicated, I would have been INVADED."

"Yes."

"Well, for me it's no problem. I just slip away into the night. The warmth of exile in the Southern Kingdoms and the embrace of my wife."

"Weeveston, you got married."

"Oh, yes, for ages now. Arranged, but she is pleasant enough, as wives go. But she took one look at this place and repaired to her father's estates in the south. Something about mold growing in her hair.

"But never mind that now. You have released me old friend. You have released me! I will instruct my household to pack at once. "

"Probably for the best. The Orc should descend on the town shortly after midnight."

"Oh how very gruesome and terrifying."

"Yes, I thought it a nice touch."

"The only thing old boy," the Duke said, the smile dropping from his face, "His my Uncle. He will take it hard. He will come for revenge."

"No worries, Weeveston. I can handle your Uncle Torvalds."

"I wish you would."

"As a favor to you," said the Wizard. "Bon Voyage!" Then he gave a half-bow, and, in the way of Wizards, he disappeared in puff of smoke. 


[^and, as two men will, sitting both alone at the same bar, they struck up a conversation]:


<!-- AFTER HE MEETS THE INNKEEPER, he thinks ___ Maybe not the entire city, thought Oddna. Perhaps there were a few things worth saving -->


"And the power. The limitless power. It should be I that make this connection with the source. Lest this power fall in to the hands of some EVIL wizard."


# Propping the Kid Up


From Wizard's point of view -- walking to the Inn -- knowing that that they have good Lamb -- Later, after a fine repast he would remove himself to a high hilltop and watch the city burn. A pleasant break from his usual toil. 

Boltac -- good city for business. 
Wizard -- hmm, yes, so far. 
Boltac -- Lots of trade

Wizard -- but what happens when all the adventurers are killed. 


Boltac dragged the unconscious Farm Boy out the front door by the shoulders. He placed him on the ground, then locked the shop door. Across the street, Boltac saw an empty bench in front of the Bent Eelpout Tavern. Perfect, thought Boltac. 

As he dragged lad across the street, Boltac muttered, "What were you thinking? Loan you a sword? Are you crazy? Well, of course your crazy." With much grunting, Boltac struggled to prop the lad up on a bench in front of the Bent Eelpout Tavern. He looked up at the hideous, twisted fish on the Tavern's faded sign and a longing for ale filled him. 

"Look kid," he said to the gently snoring boy on the bench, "It's for you own good. I mean, if you didn't see that coming, you're not going to see anything else coming. And that wasn't even tricky. You know what's tricky? Wizards are tricky."

Boltac watched the boy breathing in his sleep. He seemed even younger now that he was unconscious. After a moment he said, "Okay, no charge for the concussion. And you're  welcome." and went inside the tavern.  


# Borrow a Cup of Ale #

Boltac sucked the marrow from what remained from a leg of lamb. Then he wiped his chin with a trencher of bread, sucked a mighty gulp of ale and said, "Asarah, I will wager that you make the finest lamb of any wench in any tavern in any land."

"You're a bold man, to call the mistress of the house a wench in her own establishment," answered the dark-haired woman behind the bar, pretending to be upset. 

"It is because someday, I will make an honest woman of you."

"It will take a better man than you."

"A better man than I would fall afoul of your charms and be ruined. I am cunning, I have a fortune, I will tame you yet."

Asarah laughed and returned to the kitchen. It was an old game she played with most all of her customers, but with Boltac, somehow it was different. For one thing, he was not just another traveller. He was a man of standing in the town of Robrecht. A merchant who kept his store across the street from the inn. He was rumored to have a great fortune, but there was always a worried sadness about him. And if he had a fortune, why did he stay here. He could have gone anywhere in the four Kingdoms. Why would anyone stay in this clammy, dismal center of the nowhere called Robrecht?

He was not what you would call handsome. His hair had thinned and beneath his broad shoulders he was running to fat. That didn't bother Asarah. Neither did the the fact that he always tried to cheat her on his bill. Claiming that she had overcharged him, or that an ale was bad halfway through didn't bother her either. Supposedly he was wealthy enough to drink in any Inn or establishment he wanted. With the Duke, even, but he always seemed to wind up back at the Bent Eelpout. 

It was a strange courtship, to be sure. But, pretty as she was, Asarah was no spring maid any more. And courtship, any courtship was a flattery to be welcomed. Since her husband had passed and left her freighted and weighed with the responsibility's of a 

Besides, Boltac could have  

Asarah dropped two roast chickens and another leg of lamb at a table and scanned the room. At this instant everyone was fed and watered and aled. She had the moment to herself. Tucking her tray under her arm she made her way back to the bar. 

"Asarah, can I borrow an ale," asked Boltac. 

"I hate to think what condition you'll give it back to me." She quipped and was pleased to see that he smiled back.

"I promise, it will be liquid. But seriously, can I borrow an ale?"

"What? No. Who asks such a thing?"

"Exactly!" said Boltac, pounding his fist on the bar. "Who asks such a thing? But people do. I swear to heaven they do. A young man, not 20 minutes ago, walked into my store and had the nerve to ask me if he could borrow a sword."

"What? You mean like you'd ask a neighbor to borrow a cup of sugar."

"Yes, exactly. Except when you borrow a cup of sugar, you don't go off and use it to get yourself killed trying to save some damn fool... Priestess of Dar. 

"Oh, virgin love," she said with a look in her eye that made Boltac realize that shattering her illusions about the Priestess of Dar would be the wrong thing to do. 

"Hmmm," he said into his beer. 

"So, did you loan him the sword?"

"No," snapped Boltac, foam flying from his lips. "I hit him over the head with a club, dragged him across the street and left him unconscious on the bench out front."

Now her eyes flashed dark against the wave of her hair. "How *could* you?" 

"It was easy, actually, I just took my... Look, woman. When you pick up a sword you pick up a lot of other things with it. And if the lad wasn't ready to deal with the ambush of a shopkeeper with a bad leg, then he certainly wasn't ready to deal with whatever dangerous and vile thing he meant to bash in the head to preserve the honor of his wench."

"That word again, Wench, you said she was a priestess."

"Same difference."

"It's not and you know it," said Asarah. "Don't you see? How romantic it is?"

"I see how stupid it is."

"No," said Asarah, growing upset. "That's how she will know. The only way she can know!"

"Know what, that he's an idiot."

"The girl, she's in danger right?"

"I think it was something more along the lines of a fight for her honor, but sure, let's say she's in danger."

"Danger. She's been kidnapped, let's say. And she's being held captive at the bottom of horrible dungeon."

"Certainly are plenty of horrible dungeons around Robrecht," said Boltac, looking around the room as if he wished the subject would change itself. 

"Oh, it's so romantic. And he goes to rescue her and when he *does* rescue her that's how she *knows*."

"Knows what?"

"That he loves her. That he really, truly loves her above all others."

"That's how she'll know he's a muscle-headed idiot who's good with a sword."

"But he can't because some fat, greedy merchant wouldn't loan him a sword."

"No," said Boltac, pushing his anger back down, "I could loan him a sword and armor and everything else in my store. He can't because he DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO USE A SWORD!"

"Keep your voice down," hissed Asarah. You're disturbing the other patrons!"

"Patron," quipped Boltac across his empty tankard. 

Asarah slammed a full ale down in front of him and said. "There's no romance in your life. No passion. I feel sorry for you Boltac." And then she stormed off into the back. 

"Safer that way," Boltac muttered into the foam of his first sip. 


[[ and then, thinking better of it, he took a sword off the rack -- not his best sword and not his worst -- walked across the street and hung the sword belt around the neck of the unconscious boy. 

As he looked at him. Boltac wondered, was he all that different. At that age? The madness of youth? The kind that drives a young man to abandon his family, travel, see the world. Fall in love? Seek adventures? 

Maybe not. Maybe the only difference was, Boltac was just cunning enough to have survived. And that kid? Ehhh, that kid didn't stand a chance. 


]]
---

Asarah -- but you see that's how she knows he loves her. He comes for her, risks everything against all odds for the love of his life. 

Boltac -- that's how she knows he's an idiot. 

Asarah -- You're a bitter, bitter man. 

Boltac -- What because I make good sense?

Asarah -- Because there's no romance in your life. No passion. No magic. 

Ugh, thought Boltac. Magic that's worse than romance


* She gives him a bit of handkerchief and lace to see if he can find more of it. He set's it as a favor on his helmet. (the ugliest helmet anyone had ever seen. That has a powerful magical ability, uniquely suited to Boltacs unusual (well unusual for an adventurer) skills.

-Isn't that right, Asarah?" but when he turned back, she was gone.

# Boltac v. Wizard

"She is a fine woman," said the man sitting two seats away at the bar. 

"Hunrn," grunted Boltac, for all the sentiment that gave away. When he turned he saw that the speaker was dressed in an expensive black fabric, with a sash of blue as counter point to a fancy gentleman's sword with a brilliant blue jewel in the hilt. He had the look of money about him. Boltac didn't remember seeing him when he came in. 

"Someone should do something about such adventurers," said Boltac, they are a plague on commerce and the commonwealth alike."

"Perhaps someone will," ventured the stranger, somewhat cryptically." "What business brings you to our fair city."

"Hmm, city," said the man, with shake of his head, "Ashtantis, that's a city. Squalipoor, Yorn, those are cities. This is a fish drying village with delusions of grandure."

"More like delusions of glory," said Boltac as he raised a glass, not sure he liked the other man's tone. "You have travelled then, a trader?" Asked Boltac, sniffing around for a profit. 

"More of a wandering scholar," said the man.

"What have you learned here," Boltac asked, sure that the man wasn't a scholar, but playing along anyway. 

"This is, without a doubt, the finest leg of lamb I have ever had."

Boltac smiled and said, "Tell her that." With a nod towards the kitchen, "She'll not believe me."

"Magic in the kitchen, sheer magic. I should give quite a lot to know the secrets of her art."

Boltac shrugged, "Why waste the time. Why not just come here and eat."

"Hmm, so, public, so... common."

"Yeah, well, the surroundings do leave something to be desired."
 
"What is an Eelpout?" 

"An Eelpout? You don't know what an Eelpout is?"

"I am, as they say, not from around here."

"Eeh, yeah, no doubt. So an Eelpout is, well, imagine an ugly fish."

The man with the blue sash did not change his expression. 

"Seriously, envision it in  your head."

"I am."

"Oh, well, then it's nowhere near ugly enough. It's so ugly, this Eelpout, that to think of it is to "

"I have seen a great many ugly things," said the man in a way that indicated that he, the far worldlier man, was growing tired of this exchange. 

"But you've never seen an Eelpout, is what I'm saying."

"No."

"Ugliest Godsdamned fish in the world."

"And bent?"

"Drunk, I'd guess. Probably nothing uglier in the universe than an Eelpout on a bender."

"Then why would one name an establishment after such a creature."

"No idea," said Boltac. "Mystery of it all."

"Ah, mystery."

Asarah left the kitchen with a well-ladened tray. She looked over to the bar and gave both of them one her smiles. The smile had enough wattage behind it, and she threw her hair just so, that Boltac started to rethink his position on romance. She was so beautiful, and strong. Not that he could find the words to tell her that. But having her always just a few steps across the street had been a comfort in ways that even know he didn't fully understand. 

"The only mystery," said the Stranger, "Is why someone hasn't swept such a radiant creature off her feet."

The smile fell from Boltac's face like a sheet of ice falling from a castle wall. "In the gentle words of the virgin Priestesses of Dar, come again?"

"Oh, nothing. It's just, such a rare creature. I wonder why she stays in this... squalor."

"Squalor? Buddy, I'm eatin' here."

"Oh, I meant no offense. It is what you are *used* to after all. "

"Eh, her husband owned this inn. He died and that's her hand of cards.


"Yeah, she deserves better. The Eelpout has seen better days."

"Oh, ho ho ho ho, ho," chortled the man. "You're not excepted, my grubby little merchant. She deserves better than all of you. Perhaps as a chef to an Duke or a King or someone even more powerful," he said with a flair of his nostrils.  He threw a gold piece (more than three times enough for the bill) on the bar and said, "See that she gets that, my good man." 

"Rich prick," thought Boltac. As he watched the man go he was sure that the prick made the mistake of thinking that because he had money it meant he had power. As he watched him go, he muttered a prayer to the endlessly haggling Gods of commerce, "Just get me a chance to negotiate with that guy. He won't feel so high and mighty after that, I promise you."

Since there wasn't an offer attached, the Gods of Commerce didn't hear his plea. But other, older Gods -- the ones in charge of punishing Hubris -- they heard Boltac's plea loud and clear. 

When Asarah returned, Boltac indicated the coin on the bar and said, "That's for both of us. He said you could keep the change."

"What a fine gentleman he turned out to be!" she exclaimed, marveling at the gold."

"Oh yeah, real prince of a guy. I'll take another one, when you get a chance."

Rattick oozes his way in.

# Giving the kid the sword #


# The Orcs Attack #

"Hork, Hork, Hork."


You know which end to hold on to?

"But I can't pay you."

"What good is money, kid? The city is burning and they stole the woman I love."



 

Across the street, he could still see the boy, Relan? Yes, he thought it was Relan, asleep on the bench in front of the inn. How peaceful he looked. Boltac hoped that he wasn't dead. He hadn't hit him that hard, had he? And if the lad couldn't survive a tap like that, than his adventures would be short and predictable indeed. Gah, the stupidity of youth.

# Rattick, back at the Dungeon #

Like all survivors, Rattick had found a way to profit from the sack of Robrecht. At the first signs of the assault, he had fled to the alleys. And then into the sewers. And then, by means of one of the secret ways that well-known to the darker and more desperate sort, made his way out into the wilderness again. 

He stayed to the woods alongside the road, sleeping that night in a tree. Early in the morning he was awakened by the raiding party leaving Robrecht. Those horrible things on wolves, crying Hork, Hork, Hork as they rode the unlit roads. He wondered what treasure they had taken from Robrecht. Probably just people for food. But just in case, he followed their tracks, looking for dropped baubles by the light of morning. 

It was bad news for Robrecht, but good news for Rattick. When word got out about the sack of Robrecht, adventurers would come from all parts of the Four Kingdoms. Seeking glory, seeking loot. 


Traveling carefully, it took Rattick three days to return to the entrance of the Wizard's lair. The door and the hillside containing it had been removed, as if a giant of the gods had scooped it way and thrown it over a mountain. The wolf tracks lead directly into the gaping maw. 

Ah, thought Rattick, the wizard was upping his game. Good, a more powerful wizard would lure more powerful adventurers. More powerful adventurers would have more expensive gear and weapons. This would work out fine. 

So Rattick would wait at the entrance to the Wizard's lair. When a party came, he would spin his sad tale of love and life lost in the fall of Robrecht. 

Tell them how he was there for vengeance, but realized to attempt the depths of the fiendish dungeon alone would be surest suicide. He would promise to serve his new friends faithfully

And, then, of course, feed them to the Troll steal all their things and bury them in the woods. 

Of course it would have been more comfortable to lounge in an Inn and pick his marks that way, lying in waite

He made his way back to the dung




----



The carriage rolled to a halt in front of what was left of the mine entrance.

He had his speech all ready. Please, brave companions, let me join you. I come seeking revenge for the death of my father, two villages over. I will carry your equipage, fight like a cornered wolverine, do anything that you ask of me -- but I must defeat the scourge that is on this land. 

When out from the carriage stepped, Boltac?
