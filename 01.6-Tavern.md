Asarah dropped two roast chickens and another leg of lamb at a table and scanned the room. At this instant everyone was fed and watered and aled. She had the moment to herself. Tucking her tray under her arm she made her way back to the bar. 

"Asarah, can I borrow an ale," asked Boltac. 

"I hate to think what condition you'll give it back to me." She quipped and was pleased to see that he smiled back.

"I promise, it will be liquid. But seriously, can I borrow an ale?"

"What? No. Who asks such a thing?"

"Exactly!" said Boltac, pounding his fist on the bar. "Who asks such a thing? But people do. I swear to heaven they do. A young man, not 20 minutes ago, walked into my store and had the nerve to ask me if he could borrow a sword."

"What? You mean like you'd ask a neighbor to borrow a cup of sugar."

"Yes, exactly. Except when you borrow a cup of sugar, you don't go off and use it to get yourself killed trying to save some damn fool... Priestess of Dar. 

"Oh, virgin love," she said with a look in her eye that made Boltac realize that shattering her illusions about the Priestess of Dar would be the wrong thing to do. 

"Hmmm," he said into his beer. 

"So, did you loan him the sword?"

"No," snapped Boltac, foam flying from his lips. "I hit him over the head with a club, dragged him across the street and left him unconscious on the bench out front."

Now her eyes flashed dark against the wave of her hair. "How *could* you?" 

"It was easy, actually, I just took my... Look, woman. When you pick up a sword you pick up a lot of other things with it. And if the lad wasn't ready to deal with the ambush of a shopkeeper with a bad leg, then he certainly wasn't ready to deal with whatever dangerous and vile thing he meant to bash in the head to preserve the honor of his wench."

"That word again, Wench, you said she was a priestess."

"Same difference."

"It's not and you know it," said Asarah. "Don't you see? How romantic it is?"

"I see how stupid it is."

"No," said Asarah, growing upset. "That's how she will know. The only way she can know!"

"Know what, that he's an idiot."

"The girl, she's in danger right?"

"I think it was something more along the lines of a fight for her honor, but sure, let's say she's in danger."

"Danger. She's been kidnapped, let's say. And she's being held captive at the bottom of horrible dungeon."

"Certainly are plenty of horrible dungeons around Robrecht," said Boltac, looking around the room as if he wished the subject would change itself. 

"Oh, it's so romantic. And he goes to rescue her and when he *does* rescue her that's how she *knows*."

"Knows what?"

"That he loves her. That he really, truly loves her above all others."

"That's how she'll know he's a muscle-headed idiot who's good with a sword."

"But he can't because some fat, greedy merchant wouldn't loan him a sword."

"No," said Boltac, pushing his anger back down, "I could loan him a sword and armor and everything else in my store. He can't because he DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO USE A SWORD!"

"Keep your voice down," hissed Asarah. You're disturbing the other patrons!"

"Patron," quipped Boltac across his empty tankard. 

Asarah slammed a full ale down in front of him and said. "There's no romance in your life. No passion. I feel sorry for you Boltac." And then she stormed off into the back. 

"Safer that way," Boltac muttered into the foam of his first sip. 


[[ and then, thinking better of it, he took a sword off the rack -- not his best sword and not his worst -- walked across the street and hung the sword belt around the neck of the unconscious boy. 

As he looked at him. Boltac wondered, was he all that different. At that age? The madness of youth? The kind that drives a young man to abandon his family, travel, see the world. Fall in love? Seek adventures? 

Maybe not. Maybe the only difference was, Boltac was just cunning enough to have survived. And that kid? Ehhh, that kid didn't stand a chance.

Asarah -- but you see that's how she knows he loves her. He comes for her, risks everything against all odds for the love of his life. 

Boltac -- that's how she knows he's an idiot. 

Asarah -- You're a bitter, bitter man. 

Boltac -- What because I make good sense?

Asarah -- Because there's no romance in your life. No passion. No magic. 

Ugh, thought Boltac. Magic that's worse than romance


* She gives him a bit of handkerchief and lace to see if he can find more of it. He set's it as a favor on his helmet. (the ugliest helmet anyone had ever seen. That has a powerful magical ability, uniquely suited to Boltacs unusual (well unusual for an adventurer) skills.

-Isn't that right, Asarah?" but when he turned back, she was gone.

"She is a fine woman," said the man sitting two seats away at the bar. 

"Hunrn," grunted Boltac, for all the sentiment that gave away. When he turned he saw that the speaker was dressed in an expensive black fabric, with a sash of blue as counter point to a fancy gentleman's sword with a brilliant blue jewel in the hilt. He had the look of money about him. Boltac didn't remember seeing him when he came in. 

"Someone should do something about such adventurers," said Boltac, they are a plague on commerce and the commonwealth alike."

"Perhaps someone will," ventured the stranger, somewhat cryptically." "What business brings you to our fair city."

"Hmm, city," said the man, with shake of his head, "Ashtantis, that's a city. Squalipoor, Yorn, those are cities. This is a fish drying village with delusions of grandure."

"More like delusions of glory," said Boltac as he raised a glass, not sure he liked the other man's tone. "You have travelled then, a trader?" Asked Boltac, sniffing around for a profit. 

"More of a wandering scholar," said the man.

"What have you learned here," Boltac asked, sure that the man wasn't a scholar, but playing along anyway. 

"This is, without a doubt, the finest leg of lamb I have ever had."

Boltac smiled and said, "Tell her that." With a nod towards the kitchen, "She'll not believe me."

"Magic in the kitchen, sheer magic. I should give quite a lot" 


What is an Eelpout?" 




Let Asarah and Boltac fight before she is kidnapped. 

Boltac leaves to summon the guard. 

He goes to collect Asarah, but she won't come. He curses her as a fool. She throws a knife at him. Sticks in the wall. 

Fine -- be independent. 

Why? Who's going to take care of me? You? Ha hahaha, Romantic Boltac?
