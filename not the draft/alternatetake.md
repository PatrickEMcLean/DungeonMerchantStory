It's a Western in which the cowboys aren't worth a damn and the general store owner saves the day.


I first saw Boltac -- I was a bastard, like any other bastard. A masterless boy run riot through most of my life. My mother died in childbirth. My father killed in a war, perhaps drowned in a well. Or perhaps he ran off. 

"He's a bad man," the Chamberlain told, Boltac, "and no good will come of him." 

"No good will come of trifling with him," said Boltac, and made a motion as if he was to spit. 

We all knew he was a man with a past. What none of us realized was he was a man with a future. I had the nerve to ask him to borrow a sword. He hit me on the head

then he gave me the sword. He was like that. 

Endless hours

Let me slow down and tell you something of the place that I live. 


Now I am first Knight of Boltac, granted the landholdings of the North. The most dangerous-- I am accounted a brave man by many deeds and more tales, but I will tell you. In all my days, I have never seen anything more brave than a fat shopkeeper with a limp, setting out to rescue the woman he loved.
