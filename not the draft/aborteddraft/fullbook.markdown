# The Merchant's Revenge

## Intro

wwwwwwdwwwdwwwawwww - takes me through the darkneess

Just as Wizardry is the granddaddy of all merchants and stores. Boltac is the granddaddy of all merchants and stores in CRPG. To understand how magnificent this character (really store, we never learn much about the man himself except (he'll sell you his arms)) his character is merely imputed from his actions (as everyone's is I guess.)

Boltac is then, a perfectly ruthless market. Arbitraging his monopoly privileged fully and perfectly every single time. In economic terms, he had perfect knowledge of the elasticity of demand. Something companies would give their eyeteeth to have perfect knowledge about. Perfect knowledge does not exist. And the whole of useful, durable knowledge about pricing can be summed up 

If you've ever negotiated a salary or a project payment or for the purchase of a brightly colored statue, then you'll know that feeling -- that awful lingering feeling that you might have left money on the table -- but that's just the thing with Boltac. He never left money on the table. And he never lost a sale because he asked for too much.

-- In short, he must have been the greatest Merchant there ever was. 

What's a story about that guy like?

To be honest, I have this predilection for telling ordinary tough-guy tales with people who are cunning rather than strong as protagonists (see also, How to Succeed in Evil) I also like business and know something about it. Where most  writers seem know very little about how a market economy functions and like the idea of it even less. 

But this time was a little different. This magnificent character was lurking there all the time. And to have the fat merchant be the guy who turns out to be the hero -- well shit -- that's unexpected at every turn. 

So I just had to write it.

# Chapter One

In the middle of nowhere, there is, somewhat paradoxically, a place that on the road to everywhere. It has evolved from a crossroads to a trading post, from a trading post to a village, from a village into a town, from town into a city and from a city into something that was almost, but not quite big enough to be a kingdom.

To be sure the place is not without it's charms, but we're not to discover them just yet. So let it suffice to point out that, at the center of the city there was a river running through a deep canyon. And, in the very center of the river, rising up to above the level of the canyon, there was a rock. It was a spire of unyielding, unrepentant granite that seemed as arrogant and undeniable as life it self. 

For centuries, the river that had cut the canyon had torn at this spire of rock attempting to remove it, topple it, reduce it to bits of gravel or specks of dust that the river knew belonged at the bottom of a far, far off sea. 

But the rock remained, and the river persevered. And for all the centuries they had both been at it, only one consequence could be observed. A thick mist billowed from the depths of the canyon at all times and created around the rock a persistent pearl of mist. 

And rising from this pearl is a tower. And at the very center of this tower, on the very center of the rock, sat a man who very much wanted to be a King. Worse than wanted, in fact, for he had always been raised to believe that he would one day be a King. But through a cruel mixture of inbreeding, bad table manners, internecine politics and just plain bad luck, he had been stuck with Robrecht. The nothing in the middle of everywhere. 

The Duke yawned mightily, then thought the better of it. He was holding court, such as it was. And here in the remote and unimpressive Dutchy of Robrecht, that mean that he sat on an uncomfortable wooden chair and settled disputes. It was, in this mountainous, benighted place 

"He had advantage of my goat, sire. And I desire compensation," said the cross-eyed Goatherd who stood before him. Well, one of the goatherds it appeared. At the end of his statement he cast a terrible glare at what must surely be another goatherd. Who else would wear a goat-skin helmet. Was the helmet, the Duke wondered, the man's idea of formal dress?

"Sire," prompted the goatherd 

"Advantage?" asked the Duke, unable, with his formal, courtly upbringing, to understand how having a goat might be an advantage. It's not that there were no goats in the Mercian Empire. It's that he had been insulated from all creatures that were shaggy and uncultured from the time he had left the womb.

"He had knowledge of my best NannyGoat."

"Knowledge? I don't understand, of course he has knowledge of your animal," he said, glancing at the dull-eyed, leather-helmeted man who was being accuse of bestiality, "he is a fellow-goatherd, is he not."

"No my lord," said the cross-eyed man, blushing with the weight of what he must now make painfully obvious. "He..." and he thrust 


"Oh. OH!" said the Duke, the facts of the case finally becoming clear. "Really. What was it like?" asked the Duke.

The guard to his immediate left, began a coughing fit. This was a pre-arranged signal from the the Duke's High Councilor that the Duke was getting dangerously off track again. The Duke's guards did a lot of coughing. 

"Very well," the Duke said, looking directly at the guard, and behind him his High Councilor."I command you to violate one of his sheep."

"WHAT!"

"Yes, yes, my good man, that is justice. He has had one of yours, so you must have one of his. An eye for an eye and a ewe for a ewe, you see." The Duke said, feeling awfully proud of himself. But by the look on the goatherd's face, he could see that his legal acumen was lost on this man. 

The guard continued to cough. The Duke became worried about how might talk his way out of his ruling without seemingly he he was contradicting himself. For that was the only mortal sin a person in power might truly commit. Seeming to contradict themselves. 

But why he should worry about it with these people he couldn't understand. What taboo had he crossed. It was a perfectly logical explanation. He was a perfectly logical ruler. And why did ruler's have to explain themselves to their subjects anyway? Maybe it was just Dukes. He was pretty sure if he was a King he wouldn't have had to explain himself to...

The Wizard appeared in the great hall. And this is not to say he made an entrance. One minute there was an empty space on the cold stone floor and the next, there he stood. Shaven Pate, black robes dark circles under his eyes, strange stains underneath his fingertips -- one moment he wasn't there, and the next, he was. The Wizard Appeared.  

There was, naturally, a gasp as fawners and onlookers jumped backwards from the man who had appeared in their midst, smelling a brimstone and alchemy.

"Sorry for the intrusion, Weaveeston. I need a word."

Everyone in in the room gasped again. This magical popping-in man had not been announced, he had not been admitted, had not be recognized, had not bowed and worst of all he had not addressed the Duke by his title. He had called him by his first name.

"Must it be now?" asked the Duke. This was also shocking. Royalty asking an interloper for permission The general feeling among the crowd was that this was a beheading offense. And since everyone in Robrecht liked a good execution, they watched with great expectations. 

But the Duke did not follow the time honored formula. Instead of crying out, "Off with his head!" at the top of his voice, he meekly asked, "Must it be now." 

Another gasp. What was this? Royalty asking an interloper for permission? Now both of the Duke's flanking guards were coughing vigorously. And, standing by the tapestry, the High Councilor turned a deeper, more indignant shade of purple than this part of the world had seen in many years. 

"Oh," said the wizard. "This isn't convenient for you. I am sorry. Pray, continue with your amusements. My time is of no conseqâ€“" In mid-sentence, with a wave of his hand he turned the cross-eyed goat herd in a rather lovely looking brown and white nannygoat. Everyone in the room, including the Duke this time, gasped in fear. Well, everyone except the Goatherd in the leather helmet. He smiled at the newly minted goat with an unwholesome gleam in his eye. As he rubbed his hand along the length of rope that held up his trousers, the Nanny goat began bleating fearfully.

Over the bleating the Wizard said, "Please, carry on."

No one moved. The only sound was the clacking of the goat's hooves as she/he wisely made for the exit as fast as her newly made and terribly confused legs would carry her. 

After a pause, the Duke came to his senses. "Guards," he began. But he needed say no more than that. The stout, mailed fellow on his right, drew his sword and advanced towards the wizard. 

The wizard watched as the the guard raised his razor sharp sword high above his right shoulder. The prospect should have been terrifying, for clearly that sword was going to come down shortly and twains, as they say, would be cleft. 

"Tiresome," muttered the Wizard. He waved his hands, and every bit of metal on the advancing guard was suddenly and irresistibly attracted to the guard's mail shirt. The guard folded in upon himself and collapsed to the floor. 

Gasp, said the room again.

Exasperated that the crowd wasn't getting the point, the Wizard cried, "Still gasping? What do you want, for me to strike someone down with a pillar of flame? What does it take? Shall I underline it for you? I AM A HORRIBLE MAN. ODDNA THE TERRIBLE. Master of the arcane arts and eldrich mysteries... so on and so forth, so GIVE ME THE ROOM. Go on. Flee."

And so they did. The remaining guards dragged their pretzeled comrade with them along the floor. And when the oaken door slammed behind them, the Wizard Oddna and the Duke were the only people left in the room. 

"There," said the Wizard, "That's better."

"I apologize for my subjects," said the Duke, "they are a bit... provincial."

"Thick is the word I would have used."

"Would you care for some wine," asked the Duke as he draped his leg over the side of his chair and slumped with a false exhaustion that only comes with never having worked a day in your life.

"Get out," said the Wizard, as he considered the tapestry on the wall behind the throne. 

"Excuse me?"

"I said, get out. Abdicate. Leave this place. And take everyone with you."

"I wish that I could," said the Duke, "I never wanted to come to this damp, grey place to begin with."

"Ah, well there you go," said Oddna, "I love it when things are easy. Did you say there was wine?"

"Sadly," said the Duke.

"Sadly? I thought you said there was wine."

"Oh wine. We've got it by the barrelful. And by the bottleful in cabinet over there -- since you've run off all my servants, subjects and goat herders, I suggest you help yourself. All told this tower and keep contains more wine than I could drink in three lifetimes. Although the prospect of staying here for three lifetimes," the Duke chuckled as he made a slicing motion across his throat."

"I don't think you understand, this is a courtesy call. What I mean to say is that this request is for your benefit, not mine."

"Steady on, old boy," said the Duke. "I'm on your side. I'm ready to do as you command. You want this kingdom -- well this dismal little duchy, I say you can have it. Good riddance to fickle mountain weather, thick-ankled peasant girls and goat violators of every shape and stripe. But, here's the thing, I can't. The minute I leave my post, my family will know of it. In particular my Uncle Torvald, do you know my Uncle Torvald?"

"Can't say I have had the pleasure," said Oddna, fighting back an urge to engulf the Duke in flames with a clap of his hands. 

"I have the burden of carrying a great name. Weaveeston Prestidigitous RampartLion Toroble the 15th, in fact. And this name means that I am not free do what I would like. I am not free to marry who I like. I am not free to live where I like. I have been sent here, and if I abdicate, Torvald Toroble will have me killed. Either by assassin or generalship of an army on it's way to a glorious lost cause or perhaps just with a good old-fashioned hunting accident."

"How do you know?" asked Oddna, still trying to reason with him. 

"It's what he did to my father. Hunting "accident" and when dear old Dad survived that, then sent his very own doctor to poison the man."

"Damn it, man," cried Oddna, "I'm trying here. Do you realize how had I'm trying. I don't want to be the stereotypical Evil Wizard. Move in, blight the land, torment the villagers."

"I never suggested that you were," said the Duke, with a look of care on his face.

"I have been a good neighbor, have I not?"

"You have, no one could say different."

"I could have swept in from the East and just taken that mine and cavern system for myself. Killed all your minors, released horrible creatures into the countryside. Right? Could have done that, couldn't I."

"Yes, you could have, but I don't feel that you are the kind of --"

"Paid gold on the barrel head for it. Didn't I."

"You did, please, Oddna, what has gotten into you? You are a fine neighbor." said the Duke, trying to tell this powerful and somewhat crazed man what he wanted to hear. 

"Yes, I am," the Wizard said, calming enough to take a healthy gulp of wine. "I am a fine neighbor, but you, and I mean the royal you, Duke Robrecht, are not."

"Ugh, Robrecht as a name. Why the thought is simply ghastly."

"Not you, your subjects. The little people that infest the land."

"Ah, taxpayers," said the Duke, "Yes, my Uncle says I am here to farm them."

"Herd them? Would herd them be the word."

"Yes, I suppose it would. I am herd them until tax time. And then I shear them and release them back into their fields."





<!-- The conversation out -->

 

"No, I'll walk. I'm to upset to pull off the teleportation trick again. Would just imprison myself halfway through a tree."

"Well, take my coach, at least. No need for you to walk all the way back."

"No, no, I wouldn't hear of it. I've been an ass. I've barged in unannounced, I've hit your man with Wilhpson's spell of Annealing. Threatened you with ultimatums. I swear Weaveeston, on my mother's grave, the soil of which is indispensable for the making of certain potions, I never wanted to be another Evil wizard. A screeching, fire-throwing caricature of myself. But the world... the world will drive a man to it."

"Ah, hmm, yes." said the Duke. "You should meet my Aunt Etheline."

"Torvalds' wife?"

"Oh no, he had her killed long ago. Needlepoint accident. He has something of a penchant for killing relatives. No Etheline is his sister. And she is the ruthless one."

"Well, that makes me feel better."

"Better?"

"Yes, I would never do such a thing to my own family."

"Your extended family doesn't own and fight over estates and dominions that cover nearly a third of the known world."

"Perhaps you have a point. But I would draw the line at assassinating my own family."

"I do too," said the Duke, "But only because I don't have the means or talent to get away with it." 

"Oh and I should mention, I've dispatched a raiding party."

"Raiding party, well that doesn't sound so frighting."

"Of Orcs,"

"Orcs? What are those?"

"Riding wolves."

"Well whatever they are, they can't be very large, riding wolves."

"Gigantic wolves."

"Yes, but what is an Orc?"

"My latest work. Terrible, terribly murderously bloodthirsty creatures. Stronger and faster than a man. Some cultivars have tusks, other do not. They all have greyish-green skin, almost impervious to weapons -- if not for the constant interruptions I would have gotten that right. I do feel bad about it, but it seems the only way to get the peace in which I need to work."

"Well, I understand, you were upset, it's just a raiding party. Probably do the old town some good. A little raiding. Till up the soil, attract more adventurer's. Defend good ol' Robrecht."

"No, no that's not the point. You see, old boy, I mean to drive you out. Work salt into the earth so nothing will ever grow here again. A few thousand Orcs."



---

At first I though they would stop coming. You know, after most of the first wave fell into my traps and my pets had taken out the survivors. But they just kept coming. An endless horde of them. 

Most died on the upper levels, but the few that managed to 

So I have spies and turncoats, more diabolical traps to fashion. Strategems, force deployment strategies. But the problem is, it's a constant worry. A strain and a distraction from my real, important work. I tell you Weaveeston, I am close to isolating and controlling the very source of magic itself. Think of it. A deeper knowledge an understanding of the forces that shape our world than any man has ever had before."

"I know what forces shape our world, and sadly, it is heredity."

"And the power. The limitless power. It should be I that make this connection with the source. Lest this power fall in to the hands of some EVIL wizard."


----


Wait, how many people in the raiding party. I mean how many of these Horks 

"Orcs"

"Do you have?"

"Oh, a few thousand, by now I should say!"

"oh, well, why didn't you say so?"

"what difference does it make?"

"well if it two dozen our so, it would be a mere raiding party. But a thousand, perhaps two. Yes, two thousand?"

"I'm a wizard," said the Wizard, "Just not with numbers."

"Well, a quick look at the treasury will reveal that neither am I. But, anything over 500 is clearly an army."

"So,"

"Well, I wouldn't have abdicated, I would have been INVADED."

"Yes"

"To make more horrible things?"

"Oh no, "

Riding wolves," he added with a knowing raise of his very bushy eyebrows.

In general, the Duke had little respect for magicians, clowns, bards and court jesters. In his youth he had been known to light their clothing on fire. Which, because they were no relation to the royal family, was seen as wit of the first rank. His sense of humor had not advanced much since those days. 

But the man who stood before him, was the genuine article.

This was how the Duke had first ascertained that Oddna, the Overlord of what he styled his "proving grounds" (formerly known as one of the richest mines of gemstone quality quartz in the world)  


The tapestry behind the throne, or more accurately Ducal seat of Robrecht, depicted was the greatest moment in the history of the awkward, almost-kingdom sized state. It was two bands of thugs, meeting on the very rock on which the Duke sat. And at the center of them was the great apocryphal hero of the land. A man  known only as Lloyd. He stood in the middle of the scene, which was supposed to be a mighty battle between the town of Brecht on the right bank of the River Swift and the town of Ro on the left bank. In the poorly woven tapestry, Lloyd was seen to be bending a spear, thus signifying 

In Mercia, where the Duke was from, there were lots of tapestries. They depicted great battles, great hunts, great anything really. And what made them great was that a lot of blood was being shed in them. Heroes defeating, beheading, and in one tiny corner of one gigantic tapestry that he remembered from his youth, sodomizing the barbaric enemies of Mercia.

The Duke could understand no greatness that could come from brokering the peace. Even if Lloyd had won an arm wrestling match to ensure that the new town would be known as Robrecht rather than Brechtro. 

And he slammed the stone door shut behind him. Or he would have, if the corner of the tapestry has not caught in the sill. The hell with it, thought the Duke, it's not like anybody in that accursed town of goat-fuckers is going to live through the end of the week. 

And with that he descended deep into the spire to a secret dock far below. There were plenty of boats, royalty always having to make an escape in the event that the peasantry grew wise to what a raw deal they were getting and rose up in defiance. If he survived what was sure to be an uncomfortable trip down the river, he would soon reach his family's holdings in the Southern Kingdoms. He knew that he would never be a king after this. But at least he 

Besides, as the wizard said, he had put paid to nearly 10,000 men and women who had seen fit to try and stop him. What other reward could a hero expect. Better to be a serf than a hero. 

No, thought the Duke, from here on in I will be royalty living in exile. Fat days in the sun. His shrewish wife, many scheming mistresses and the clear wine of the Southlands. Vats and vats of it.

The roaring of the river grew closer. The Duke's stomach churned uncomfortably. He hated boats. 



----

Look here, I order my horrible creatures to do horrible things to anyone who braves the roads, and still you do nothing. 

"No, you work in my favor, you see. Fewer trading parties, fewer taxes. Fewer taxes will incite the wrath of my Uncle Torvald."

"Yes, I thought that was a bad thing?" asked the Wizard, who's naturally quick and tricky mind was getting lost in the twisted and tortured permutations of family politics. 

"It is, but not for me. He won't trust me with an army, as I am both wrathful and totally incompetent. So he will come at the head of heavy cavalry and ride you don't. Or," he quickly added, seeing the offended pride rising red on the Wizard's face, "You will smite his army utterly from the face of the earth. Either of which solves my problem equally well."



"So you are saying that there's no way that I will be 

"We'll that's a relief.

----

Oh that's okay, said Oddna with a smile. Wizards have a way of not being seen when they don't want to be. With a wave of his hand he transformed himself completely. The somber man in black robes witha with a shaven head and sunken eyes was gone. In his place stood a young man who could pass as a courtier in any of the richest kingdoms on the continent. Tights, a jerkin of crushed velvet adorned with a stripe of brilliant red fabric. With a flourish he drew his sword, a whisker-thin, needle-sharp dueling sword that would be all but useless where real men did battle in desperate situation. He saluted the Duke with it, raising the guard to the level of his eyes before sweeping it backward in an elaborate and courtly bow. 

"I shall take my leave of you my good Duke, in the hopes that you will likewise take your leave of this benighted place. Return the marble and gilded courts of Mercia. Robrecht is lost to the Torobles."

"I will leave the whole clammy, crumbly mess to you Oddna," 

"Look to your safety. And I shall look to mine. Let not dawn catch you "

"
Knowledge and nobility. There is precious little of either left in the world. None of it should be wasted.  




# Chapter 1.6 Minding the store

In another part of the city. a shopkeeper was down on his hands and knees, preparing to do violence to his own floor. 

# Chapter 1 - The Bad Penny/A Plague of Heroes

Boltac decided, this was the day he was finally going to get that damned coin. He heaved his bulk off the stool, slid his dirk free of his sheathe, and grunted as he lowered himself to his hands and knees. His knees made explosive popping noises. Not for the first time today, he thought,"I'm old."

In what little light that penetrated beneath his thick, oaken shop counter, He could make out the copper coin gleaming at him from the gap in the floorboards where it had been lodged. 

He hadn't remembered dropping it. But as long as he could remember, it had been there. Likely it was back from when times were good. There were a lot more coins to drop back then. 

He had let it sit there for many years on the basis that tearing up his floor and having it repaired would cost more than one copper coin. A store was in the business of making money, and wasting good coin on a floor repair that a customer would never see didn't make good sense. 

Even though this was true, the coin had still worried Boltac. And in return, he had worried it. As he sat at his stool, or stood at the counter, conducting trade, he would rub the coin with his foot. As one might absent-mindedly tongue at a loose tooth until it came free.

But this coin never loosened in it's socket. If anything it seemed to be burrowing deeper and deeper into the floor. And years of obsessive rubbing had left the top of the coin as bright as if it had newly minted. 

If it was a constant reminder of what a profit was, and underscored that Boltac had not turned one for many years. Not since things had turned bad. 

He placed the point of the dirk into the grain close to the side of the coin. Of course, this would leave an unsightly tear in his otherwise pristine shop floor, but Boltac didn't care. Even though he didn't have the money it would take to fix it, he was sick of the penny's constant taunting. 

Even rubbing it had cost him money. Three times he had his boots resoled because he had worn out the right toe rubbing that damned penny. And he needed to get them resoled again, but things had gotten so bad, even the bootmaker had left town. A sad, yet succinct commentary on the state of the town of Robrecht.

Boltac didn't know what fresh disappointments the future would bring, but today, he would have his revenge. He raised the knife. He squinted as he took aim. He imagined the shock he would feel along his arm and the satisfying thud he would make as he dug out a chip of wood. 

But before he could deliver the coup de grace, he heard the front door open. 

"Nnnnngh," Boltac said with obvious disgust, "A customer."

He rose up from behind the counter, still clutching the knife. He tried, but failed in his effort to untwist the scowl on his face as he asked, "Can I help you... sir?" The only sincerity in whole display was in the knife. It was reassuringly and unambiguously sharp. 

Near the door, looking unsure of himself, was a young man with broad shoulders and an unruly mop of long, blonde hair. He stammered, "I, uh, uh, I" he said eyes locked on the knife. 

Boltac replaced the blade in his sheath, clapped his hands together as if to dispel evil spirits. He smiled with such effort it made his face hurt and tried again, "Welcome to Boltac's General Store and Dungeon Outfittery. We have everything that a strapping young adventurer like yourself could need to loot your way to fame and glory."

"We?" asked the lad, with the kind of farm-fresh innocence that comes from hard work, clean living and getting kicked in the head by livestock. 

"Yes, the Royal We, or, in this case, the Shopkeeper's We."

"But there is only one of you," said the lad, obviously confused.

"Yes, but," Boltac ground his molars together for a second. "I am very eager to help you. What do you need?"

"I am about to embark on an adventure of high purpose and consequence." With this last phrase, Boltac's hopes lifted. These fancy words sounded like coin. Perhaps this was the customer -- the one that would break the shadow of bad luck the store and city had been under. Perhaps, perhaps, he had money to spend after all.  

"Ah yes, well, you have come to the right place."

"I hope so, sir. As it is the only place in town."

"Yes, the Duke of Robrecht himself has granted me license to purvey. He has an eye to quality, his Dukeship does, and with his warrant of commerce he personally guarantees that this," he indicated his dark, dusty store with an expansive gesture of his hands, "Is the finest merchandise you can buy in town of Robrecht."

"But it's the only merchandise I can buy in the town of Robrecht."

"Yes, I see that you are a quick study," said Boltac, directing the young man through the shelves. "I invite you to direct your keen wit towards my wares. Here we have an assortment of torches and oil bearing devices. If you notice this one, with the curved blade on the handle -- particularly good when you are surprised coming around a corner.

"Here, of course, we have our major and minor healing potions. A must for any prudent adventurer. These potions are brewed by the finest Mercian apothecaries and brought in by mule train once a moon. 

"Armor, a 

"And of course, swords. There are, various schools of thoughts on weapons. Some prefer pikes, some care for bows, but I am a traditionalist. A good dagger on one hip, a good sword on the other, and there's not much a man isn't ready for. And this," Boltact said with hushed tones of awe

"Well, that's no trouble at all," he said, "we have a number of fine weapons, made by lesser known craftsmen -- most never tested, but the mores the glory when the blade becomes famous in your hand, eh?" Boltac swung and indicated the rack of sheathed blades that extended from ceiling to floor. 

Again the young man winced. "Uh, I'm afraid..."

Boltac's smile collapse in upon itself like the poorly constructed thing it was. He shuffled over to the door and kicked a barrel filled with swords -- some still bloody, all of them nicked, none of which had sheathes. "There's always our discount barrel."


{

i've been trying to save money to buy the sword, sir. Scrounging for herbs, seeing if anyone needs rats killed. But the countryside is bare for miles around... he trailed off 

And, thought Boltac, there's not a coin left among the good (or, more to the point, morally questionable folk of Robrect to pay for pest control -- and worse, any rat that dare show it's tail has been snatched up, cooked and eaten by any one of the horde of ill-prepared adventurers who have descended upon the land seeking fortune and glory. )

They died in droves. They died in hordes. They died on the roads. Some drank themselves to death. They came back horribly wounded or touched in the brain, cluttered the thoroughfare. 

The wizard, perhaps, was an evil -- but this was certainly a plague of heroes. 

}


"I need to rent a sword," he said. 


"RENT A SWORD?" Boltac shouted. "Do you not see the sign?" he asked pointing at the sign which clearly read "All Sales Final."

"I can't read, sir."

"Oh, of course not."

"Please sir, it's so I can rescue the love of my life. She was taken, you see. By the evil wizard Oddna."

"Oh well, that changes everything," said Colbac, as his face grew hard. "Tell me more," he said, as if it was a dare.

"Well sir, she is a priestess of Dar. And, well,"

"Aren't they supposed to be virgins? Them priestesses of Dar."

The young man blushed and said, "It's more of a suggestion, than a rule, sir. If you know what I mean," his face grew serious, "but if it helps, I was a virgin, if you catch my drift."

"Help? How would that help?"

"She's gone and got herself into trouble. In the underkeep I mean. And if I had a sword, I could go and rescue her."

"Oh lad, if you had a sword, I'm sure you could. In fact, a big strong lad like yourself could probably manage it with your bare hands."

The boy looked shocked, "No sir, I could never..."

"Well, then, I suggest you find yourself another Priestess of the Eternal Flame of Questionable virtue."

"What are you saying? Look, if you are insulting the virtue of my young--"

Colbac slammed a club of knotty wood down upon his counter. "You'll WHAT?" he asked with great relish. He secretly hoping the boy would do something stupid so that he could vent his spleen. 

In a quiet voice the lad said, "I'm not asking for a discount. It's just a loan."

"It's the worst kind of discount of all," shrieked Colbac, "It's a 100% discount."

"But I'd bring it back. Maybe with a few nicks, but definitely covered in glory."

"Oh Glory is it? That would enhance the retail value."

"Yes, yes," he said eagerly, unaware of the trap he was falling into.

"Because you are such a great fighter."

"Yes, that's it."

"Powerful, strong," Colbac prompted.

"Yes."

"Well then, how about this?" Colbac slowly lifted the club off of his counter and held it above his head. He watched as the young "fighter's" trusting, cow-like eyes followed the weapons movement. Then, without the any hesitation of remorse or conscience, he dropped the heavy, burlwood shaft down on the top of his unarmored head. 
. 

As the lad collapsed to the floor unconscious, Colbac felt secure in the knowledge that he had done him a favor as well as a concussion. 

No, thought Colbac, you're no kind of fighter at all. Too earnest. Too willing to play by the rules. You won fights by cheating. And heroes cheated more than anybody. No, the young lad was better off unconscious, at least he wouldn't get his fool self killed by running off in the the dungeon. 

Colbac came out from behind his counter and dragged the boy outside. By the scruff of his neck. Colbac was not pretty, he was not graceful, but he was strong. He dragged the lad across the street and propped him up next to a drunk who was sitting on the bench in front of the Inn. Ah, what adventuring lies they would tell each other when they woke up. 



# 1.61 Pawning the Jewel

Boltac didn't say anything. He looked away and his eyes unfocused as the memories tried to come flooding back. He took a long pull on the ale, gulping down nearly half of it. 

"If you please, good merchant, I have something I would like to sell," a snake whispered in Boltac's ear and broke the spell. 

He turned to his right and beheld Rattick, too large and too watery eyes trying to fool him with their great sincerity. The glowed like great moons of reassurance. So dazzling they were that it was difficult to notice the pale, dead face that never smiled around them. Or, Boltac assumed, the knife that was coming to slit the strings on your coinpurse. 

"Ah Rattick," he said, "Have you taken those poor fools last coin before they could drink it." 

"No," Rattick sighed with great sincerity, "but if I had, just if mind you, would that be so terrible? So parasitic? After all, we are all suffering from an economic downturn of such proportion, such magnitude, that bringing coin here to Robrecht and keeping it here, why it is a matter of our very survival. 

"Economic? That's a very large word for you Rattick," Boltac said. 

"You should not be so unkind to me, stout merchant. Besides, it would be a sin to let them take their coin with them on their planned outing 

"It seems a sin to let them wander off into the hills and die, leaving their remaining coin festering at the bottom of some dark fen, troll pit or bottomless chasm." At this, Boltac clinked glasses with the weasel of a man sitting next to him. He might have been shady, disreputable, but he wasn't wrong. Besides, the man was thief. It was his job. And unlike all of the other adventurers who festered and waited in Robrecht -- Rattick was actually good at what he did. 

"Yes, you see that one there," Rattick continued, "The one with the pan for a helmet. Yes, he is the *chosen one*."

"Ah, of course, sent to to free us from the awful shadow of the wizard who has occupied the nearby tower."

"Cavern, actually. Rumor has it the old Matteschitz mine collapsed into a gigantic, secret cavern in the earth."

"Oh, ah, of course. Cavern. How silly of me," said Boltac.

"And even know, the great wizard Oddna searches beneath the earth for relics and powers of which man was not meant to know." 

"Which, will inevitably bring about the destruction of all of the Duchy of Robrecht," said Boltac, filling in the next verse. And recognizing it for the lie it was. He had never met the Wizard Oddna, and hoped he never would -- he hated magic in a way that only a trader with a lust for certain, right and ordinary commerce can. -- but if a man wanted to dig for objects in the earth, why shouldn't he? As for the tales of horrible things happening and monsters roaming the land, Boltac couldn't help but notice that these stories, and the twisted corpses and wrecked adventurers who had retunred, had only started turning up after adventurers had gone out in search of Oddna's loot. Boltac knew what he would do to anyone he caught robbing his store...

"Yes, but of course. But thankfully, the chosen one is here to save us."

"Hmm, thankfully."

"Only, there is one, unexpected problem for this auspicious young man on his world-healing hero quest."

"Yes,"

"You see the tall one, in the Mage's robe."

"Yes, the one covered in silly mystical symbols as only a true mage can be?"

"Yes. Turns out, he's the chosen one. Too."

"Ahh, so the chosen two."

"Yes, I fear it will not end well for their party, but enough of the misfortunes of others. I have a certain item that I have come into possession of a certain item which I am certain you will be interested."

"Step into my office," said Boltac, as he slid off the stool and made his way to the door. But not before casting a longing look towards the kitchen. What would 

CH 3 -- the problem with magic items

---

Asarah -- but you see that's how she knows he loves her. He comes for her, risks everything against all odds for the love of his life. 

Boltac -- that's how she knows he's an idiot. 

Asarah -- You're a bitter, bitter man. 

Boltac -- What because I make good sense?

Asarah -- Because there's no romance in your life. No passion. No magic. 

Ugh, thought Boltac. Magic that's worse than romance

---


-Isn't that right, Asarah?" but when he turned back, she was gone. 






# 1.62 Dealing with Rattick


As he gets to his shop, she thows them both out on their ear. Chosen one not strong enough to get defeat an Innkeeper -- what was the world coming to these days

Then Rattick, the thief comes into the shop. Just when he is going to have his ale in peace. 

Sipping his ale, surveying his wares. Loving his goods and lamenting that there are so few buyers. Oh in the days gone buy

But now just some seedy adventurer selling rope. 

"I have," said Rattick, "a magic item of great power, that I could be persuaded to sell you. But understand, I feel I am making a mistake parting with it. It's just," his smile looked like a wound that had become infected with teeth, "I have a sister in Blovatia, and she's terribly, terribly ill."

"Yes. I understand how hard that can be," said Colbac, "Having your only Sister taken hostage."

"Hmmm," he lied, "and with the illness and the strain of confinement I need money for the journey and for medicines and, of course for ransom. So loathe as I am to part with it, I must."

"It is a sad tale of woe you tell, brave adventurer," said Colbac, laying it on as thick has he could, "I am just happy that, humble merchant that I am, I have the means to purchase such a magnificent item, paying, of course, more than it is worth, because your sad tale of woe has moved me -- turned my heart of stone into flesh once more."

"Yeah," said Rattick, not quite comfortable with Colbac's sudden enthusiasm.

"So, shall I shower you in gold now, or can I see the item first?"

"Oh, right. Or course. I keeps it wrapped away for safekeeping."

"I'm sure you do."

Rattick reached into his pants, underneath his tremendous codpiece and retrieved a wad of dirty rags.

"Yes, I can see the value straight away," said Colbac. "My nostrils fairly burn with it.""

"Look you," snapped Rattick, no longer comfortable with being out bullshitted, "I come here in the interest of serious commerce. And you mock me."

It was all that Colbac could do not to continue the farce. He strained to make, "No, no, please. I am serious. Show me the item."

Rattick set the ball of rags on the counter and began to unwrap it with great caution. As layer after layer was peeled, back, Rattick became even more careful, to the point where he removed the last covering with his sizeable and much-sharpened dagger.  

This was Colbac's first clue that the item was magic, and quite probably cursed. For reasons more primal than profit (survival being the only thing that Colbac put above profit) Colbac was an expert on magical items. Or more correctly, he was an expert on Wizards.

Wizards, you see ran to themes. 

Gauntlets of self-abuse

<!-- Insert wizard bits. -->

"Well, what do you think?" Rattick demanded. Colbac said nothing. He backed away from what appeared to be a fist-sized ruby slowly, never taking his eyes off it. With one hand behind his back he opened the cabinet that held his most prized possession -- his gloves. 

The popular name for them were Gauntlets of Negation, but the name was inaccurate. The Gauntlets did not negate magic, put rather, were perfectly magic neutral. Like a lightning rod conducts magic away from a house, these gloves conducted magical energy away from the use. They remained totally neutral to the effect of any spell, charm, hex or incantation. 

For all there rarity and power (some even thought them not to exist) they looked like a gigantic pair of wool mittens. The kind that looked like they should be connected by a long strand of yarn to prevent them being lost or separated by an absent-minded or irresponsible child. 

As Colbac donned his gloves, Rattick eyed them greedily. They were easily worth several hundred times more than the jewel on the counter. Colbac could see the thought floating in the thief's eyeballs -- *if only I could steal them*. Colbac thought little of it. After all that's the exact kind of thought that should drift through a good thief's mind. But there was something else about his glance. Something that bothered Colbac.

"So, where'd you get this magnificent jewel then?"

"Oh, I, uh, that is to say, I prized it from the deepest depths of the Lair of the Mad Wizard, Oddna."

"You?"

"Yes, a brilliant bit of thievery, if I do say so myself."

Colbac's hand stopped inches above the jewel. The whole scene could have easily taken on an air of the absurd, if not for the obvious fear that both men had for the object on the counter. "You, yourself then?"

"Yes, the pride and prince of thieves I am."

"Oh, I can well see that," Colbac said with smile that got no farther than his lips. "But here's the thing. If I was a thief..."

"Oh, don't sell yourself short Gov, you should hear the things that are said about you around town."

"... if I was a thief, instead of just a man with a deep and abiding love for negotiation, I wouldn't waste my time or energy frittering around in some dungeon. I'd find myself a nice seat at the dungeon's entrance."

"You would," said Rattick, playing along as if every one of Boltac's words were cast from the purest fascination. 

"Then'd I'd sit there until the last survivor of a party of adventurers came along. Battered, bedraggled, probably half-dead --"

"Or three quarters dead, if you really want to save yourself the effort," Rattick offered.

Botlac nodded acknowledgment and continued, "Then'd I slip a knife in his kidney and go through his pockets for loose change and valuable magical items."

"You've got quite an active imagination there, Gov," said Rattick, looking more afraid than guilty.

"I'm sorry, did you say active or accurate."

"I said, active."

"Well," said Boltac, with a shark's smile, "It makes no difference to me, you see. I'm just a man who acquires useful and resalable items for the benefit of my customers."

"Yes, I can see that," Rattick said with great relief.

"So, tell me, this unfortunate man who bequeathed you this jewel with his dying breath."

"Ohhh, I like that one better. And it sounds so good when you tell it."

"What he in his right mind."

"Yes, yes, right and generous he was."

"Was he, perchance, muttering anything. Acting strange in any way."

"Come to think of it," Rattick said with a sheepish grin, "He was going on about some beautiful girl. And how he had to save her."

"Ah, I thought as much," said Colbac. "I will give you a gold piece for your accursed gem."

"Accursed gem. Why Gov. you wound me. You really, really do. Do you think I would pass off accursed merchandize to a man of your standing."

"Only if you thought you could get away with it."

"I cannot take so little. That's highway robbery, that's what that is."

"Yes, and you would know. If a gold piece isn't enough"

"5 gold." 

Then just collect your stone and go. Rattick's hand moved forward, then he checked himself. He knew what it was and he was loathe to touch it. One brush of a man's skin and the mindstone would posesses his thoughts utterly. Inserting desires and thoughts into it as one might inject poison into a sausage. 

No man would want such a fate. Even Colbac was wary of it ( as he was wary of all magical items. ) How much happier he would be if there were no magical items left in the world.





It was a mindstone. Anyone could see that. 
"



---


As Colbac waddled back into his store with all the grace of a hermit crab claiming a new home. He turned in the door way and then glared out into the early evening, as if daring any other adventurer to darken his doorway. From across the dirt road he heard laughter from the inn. His face twisted into a scowl as he thought of them in there. The boastful and the proud. The pretty and the brave. The one's who thought they were heroes in the making, but would all, sooner or later, wind up in Colbac's shop, broken and broke, asking for money. 

Please sir, they would all say, just a little bit more for this amulet, can't yous see the magic in it. I just need a little more to pay a healer to deal with this salamander bite. 

Colbac slammed the door as hard as he could. The panes of glass in his shop window rattled perilously but they held. 

He rubbed his leg again. These were the last days of summer and already he could feel the Winter's storms approaching in his hip. He settled back onto his stool and had a sip of beer. 

For a while, he stared at the door, as if daring the world to send another customer. But then his gaze wandered around his shop. To Colbac, of course, it was nothing special. It was his home and his store room all rolled into one. But for those broke and struggling adventurers across the street, Colbac's shop seemed a treasure trove. 
Here were enchanted Mage Robes that were stronger than steel. Heavy plate armor that not even a dragon's breath could melt. There were weapons of every imaginable size and quality. But the finest (displayed in the magically sealed case behind the counter)

2. Woman from the castle comes by. He mentions that he must come to the tower of mists to peruse the library. 

"No wait! Don't touch that!"

"But it is so pretty," said the Lady-in-Waiting.

"Yes," Boltac said, slamming a hand in a heavy woolen gauntlet over the top of it to prevent the gentle woman from whatever God-awful thing the stone might be capable of, "but who knows what else it is."

"You mean," she asked in the hushed tones of one who has live their entire lives behind large stone walls protected by brave men, "it's magic?"

"Yes," said Boltac, "It is most certainly magic, but what kind I cannot say just yet."

"Black magic." she  in a nearly breathless whisper. 

"No, all magic is the same color -- and it's all bad, no matter how helpful it might seem at first. But this gem, I have not yet been able to identify. I fear shall need to visit the library in the Misty Tower, before I can know for sure. Tell me, how fares the Duke today?"

With this question, her fascination with the mystery of the jewel disappeared. A dark frown blew across her face and disappeared into the blue sky of courtly manners. "Yes, the Duke, he is... well. Making preparations."

Preparations, thought Boltac. When the Duke made preparations, it was almost always bad for business. But still

# Giving the Kid a Sword

He looked out through the thick-paned glass window at the front of his shop. The window had been quite an extravagance. Made up of 48 identically-sized pieces of hand-blown glass in a wooden frame, it was the largest window in any residence in Robrecht. Larger, by far than any windows in the keep. Large windows sort of defeated the purpose of having a keep, the whole idea being to keep arrows and other invaders out, rather than allowing them in. 

On the same principle, Boltac's store shouldn't have had such a large window. In any other store, it would have been an easy way for thieves to help themselves. A cold moonless night, a quiet shattering noise, and off goes the inventory. But Boltac's store not only housed magic items, it was a magic item of a sort. 

The bar which held the door was enchanted. And when it was in place, it rendered the entire store impervious to entrance. Of course, some one skilled in magic or learned in the way and manner of identifying items, might find a way to overcome it, but it would take more than clubs or rocks to smash this magnificent window.

After working for several months to identify the bar, he had discovered that it was a class V ward of shutting. Or, as it was known by it's original name, Ethlezar's Ward. The final test was that he barred his door with the slightly rusted piece of black steel, and then tried to hack his way through the door with a war axe. 

He had assailed the wood for the better part of an hour. When he stopped, he was tired, the axe was dull and the door was exactly the same. He then got a fresh axe and tried the other doors, a section of the wall and even one of the timbers that had framed the building.The only sign that the building had given of the powerful enchantment coursing through it, was a slight bluish glow that happened every time the axe made contact with the outside of the building. 

How it worked, he could not say, but once he had tested and classified the effects of the item, he had faith enough to install his impressive window. Of course, it had been expensive, but those were back in the good days, when a license to retail was the next best thing to a license to make coins. Now it felt like a trap. An endless bloodletting recommended by a doctor that not only didn't want to cure his patient, but wanted to kill him as slowly and painfully as possible. 

He looked across the street to the boy he had rendered unconscious. He was unmoved and Boltac would have feared him dead, if he did not see the gentle rise and fall of the young lad's chest. He remembered when he had been his age. Young and strong and fresh off a farm of his own. A farm for to the North in a particularly hard and frozen region of Mercia, but all farms are the same -- no matter what they may grow, all farms produce a surplus of hard, boring work suitable for the endless torture of young men who crave adventure. 

He did not feel guilty to braining the lad. If it was Adventure the boy was after, he would have to withstand far worse. And if his younger self had appeared by magic before him in his own store Boltac would have done far worse. He would have tried to beat some sense into his former self. Even though he doubted it could be done. 

But how could he tell a young man of the hazards that awaited him. Of the costs to life and limb and family -- all the ways of hurt and all the ways those hurts could radiate beyond himself. It was a terrible thing to be a hero. And Boltac wished the pain of it on no one. Certainly on no one's family. 

He couldn't talk him out of it. There was simply no way to frame the words, no order to put them in that could make it through his testosterone addled brain and overcome the lust for glory. Yes, if not this priestess, he would find some other cause, or scrape or trouble. At least he wasn't off in search of that Dred Wizard that all of the other 'Adventurers' were always harassing. So few of them came back. 

But, realized Boltac, there was no stopping him. So why had he tried? Maybe because he saw himself in the lad. And would have given anything and risked everything to take back the poor choices of his own youth. 

He cursed the Bards. It was surely there fault. Putting all these ideas in young men's heads. Sending them off to war or in search of gold. But even as he did, he cursed himself. 

Damn it all. Time enough for a pint. He opened the door of the store, stepped outside, stopped and then turned around. He walked back in the store, and grabbed a sword from the sword barrel. He drew the blade and tested it's balance. Awful. He sighted down the blade? As curved as a whore's back. What an awful piece of workmanship. It was the kind of item he would willingly sell to a fool, but not the kind of weapon he would wish on his worst enemy. 

A man needed a sword he could trust. Boltac saw the shape of a terrible memory rising from the dark waters of his memory. Before the thought could full take hold of him,  slammed the sword back in the barrel. 

He went to the rack behind the counter. He removed the blade from the bottom. It was the one he would of chosen, if he were spending his own money. It was a stout, Mercian sword. At one end, it's straight blade came to a broad triangular point and the other ending with a heavy round pommel that, in the hands of someone who knew what they were doing, qualified as a weapon on it's own. It sang as he unsheathed it and begged to dance in his hand. He sighted along the blade and it's hard edge was as crisp, final unforgiving as the border between this life and the next. 

It was the kind of sword Boltac would want in his hand if he was fighting for his life. And if he had had one... No. He turned away from the mugging of guilt he knew awaited him in the alley of memory. He exited, locked the shop and walked across the slop of the muddy street.


<!-- Foreshadow him fighting for his life at the end with this sword.  -->

Relan was snoring softly. Probably a good sign. Boltac dropped the loop of the sword belt over he head and set the blade and scabbard in his lap. The lad didn't wake. Better that way, thought Boltac. The boy's gratitude was bound to be more annoying than his begging. 

Intent on a dinner and a pint, he pushed his way into the inn. On second though, a lot of pints. The night was long and the well of memory was deep. Best not to play any games. 



<!-- Both an alley AND a well of memory? Jesus McLean, tighten that up.  -->













 shook off a terrible memory 

young boys.  are full of boring hard work with which to torture young boys. 


Across the street, he could still see the boy, Relan? Yes, he thought it was Relan, asleep on the bench in front of the inn. How peaceful he looked. Boltac hoped that he wasn't dead. He hadn't hit him that hard, had he? And if the lad couldn't survive a tap like that, than his adventures would be short and predictable indeed. Gah, the stupidity of youth.


--- 

finding out that an item was magic was just the beginning. It might well have power, but what was the power and how was it used. Many men had lost lives carelessly playing with items beyond their ken. It was a dangerous business, which called for patient and cautious work. 

Luckily, for Boltac, Robrecht had a fine library. Many was the hour he would while away in the library, reading through the ancient histories, scattered lore and tale of bards gone by. It was how he had learned his trade, his real trade, the identification and mastery of magical items. He, himself did not have an ounce or iota of magic in him. But he had come to know it's workings and it's fashions all the same. 

There were the standard spells and alchemy. Spells of fireball, spells of ward and lock, potions of healing, of mana, of speed -- these were the stock-in-trade of lesser wizards. But each generation a few true Wizards would come along. They were the one's that expanded the boundaries of what was possible. Who crafted 

The Wizard who plagued Robrecht was one practitioner.  

massed one of the finest libraries 

# The Merchant Adventurer



Instead of returning to the store, he trudged into the inn.

Smell of wood smoke, roasting meat and fine ale wrapped his senses in a comforting hug. On the left was a bar running the length of the building. To the left a common room with tables. Mostly empty now, given the hour of the day and the state of the town. But in the far corner, five people sat at one of the large round tables and clanked there tankards together. 

"Huzzah," they cried, "To us, the conquering heroes!"

Gah, thought Boltac, more adventurers. Mithras save us from this plague of adventurers. They had little enough money when the descended upon the town, but after they drank what little they came with they either made an ill-advised

Hero, thought Boltac, was just another word for a misfit who couldn't find a honest purpose in the world. He had known fighters in his time, some of them good. But all of the real ones had fought for loyalty or a steady paycheck. And these creatures, that drank and boasted in taverns, while they worked up the nerve -- who's bodies littered the countryside, dismembered in terrible and remarkable ways. Who only served to aggravate the Dread Wizard Oddna -- and really was he Dread? Maybe he just wanted to be left alone. To forget his past in where ever it was he came from -- that was a good a reason as any to come to the mountains of High Robrecht.

----

Goes to bar. Asks asarah is he can borrow an ale. 

"I hate to think what condition you'll give it back to me." She quipped. And the. She smiled. And just like that, gravity was a little lighter and he forgot the problems of the world for a little while. 

"Don't worry, it will be liquid."

And then, miracle of miracles, she laughed.  She she shook her head and as he long black hair rippled like waves through the water the crusty old merchant melted and for just a second you could see the little boy inside. 

Then she broke the spell by asking, "but seriously 'Tac" what's gotten into you?"

"Oh, he said, running a hand through his thinning hair in frustration, "this kid just came into my store asking to borrow a sword."

What? You mean like you'd borrow a cup of sugar. 

Yes, exactly. Except when you borrow a cup of sugar, you don't go off and use it to get yourself kills trying to save some damn fool... 
What?

Priestess of Dar. 

"Oh, virgin love," she said with a look in her eye that made Boltac realize, telling the truth about the less than virginal priestess was the wrong thing to do. 

"Hmmm," he said into his beer. 

"So, did you loan him the sword?"

"No," snapped Boltac, foam flying from his lips. "I hit him over the head with a club, dragged him across the street and left him unconscious on the bench out front."

Now her eyes flashed dark against the wave of her hair. "How *could* you?" 

"It was easy, actually, I just took my..." he trailed off, realizing that he just waded too deeply into the wrong answer. It did not pay to upset the only licensed provider of ale for 10 miles around, so he tried again. "Look, woman," realizing that he had gone even farther wrong as he said it, "What do you think monsters in that dungeon would have done to him. What do you think that wizard would have done. It's no pink tea you know. "

"Wouldn't you go?"

"No I wouldn't"

"And you *do* realize what it means?" she asked, laughing at him. 

He's zero mostel

Rattick is Peter Lorre

The kid is...

THe duke is the guy from Best in Show...

Oddna is Peter Guest

Boltac stands up to a guy much taller than he is. 

---

Next bit -- hates himself for getting his hopes up. -- he knocks the kid unconscious -- drags him across to the inn and props him on the bench. 

Gets a beer, flirts with Asarah -- talks about how bad business has been. They talk about heroes -- he's bleak, "Why if it wasn't for you good Red ale and your mutton sandwiches, I might give up hope altogether" he said, shocked to hear the truth from his own mouth. 

Rattick comes to sell an item -- she says, see things are looking up. 

They go across the street -- Rattick leaves -- Boltac watches him go -- sees the boy -- gives him the sword. Comes back, there is a handmaiden there. She seeks a dagger for protection. 




As he enjoys his beer, Rattick bends his ear a little. Seed the heroes

the store is dark brown, age polished wood, with a fireplace providing what little heat there is. There are windows of hand-blown glass. 


--



It was not a large store, but every square inch of it was packed with merchandise of one kind or another. Here were torches or various grades and sizes, a lantern that glowed when it came into proximitity with danger

By the door there was a bucket of used swords. There were spears, just for show, for dungeons and treasure hordes were confined spaces -- not the kind of space 








---
 For all he knew it could have been there for years. Maybe it was back at the beginning of it all. Back when times were good and the money and goods had flowed freely. 

Colbac slid his dirk out of it's sheath and placed the point beside the coin. As he did, he heard the door open. His heart leapt with the thought that a customer had walked in the store. But other, more practical parts of him loathed the kind of person who walked into his store these days. 

It is difficult to be a shopkeeper who hates his clientle. 

For Colbac's customers weren't what they once were. 






---
He had devolved from a purveyor of fine merchandise to traders and noblemen, to an outfiter. 

----

For the the 15th time today, Colbac looked down at the coin wedged between the dark, oak floorboards of his shop. It was a [shilling], not worth much. And it was so well-wedged in between the floorboards that Colbac believed to get it out would damage the floor more than the coin itself was worth. 

He remembered when that coin had found it's way into that crack. Those were busier times. He had spent his days rushing to and fro, helping the constant stream of noble customers that formed his clientle. For some it was spices from the East. For others the luxurious garments of silk that were woven only in the South. The men of the North brought furs that the locals prized highly. And all the finest homes were furnished with the choices items from the west. 
In those days, many a coin found it's way to the floor amidt the hustle of business. And he remembered stepping on this one and feeling it slip into the crack. 

Now it gleamed at him from the darkness beneath his counter, a reminder of how good things had been, and how bad they were now. A dark shadow had fallen across the Kingdom of Robrecht. The once proud trading post nestled in the high mountains at the intersection of the North road and the West Road (as the population to the South and East knew them) or the South Road and the East Road (as those to North and the West named them) 

But one thing everyone agreed upon. In those days, Robrecht was at the center of everything. And at the center of Robrecht had been Colbac's store. 

Now he was lucky if a new day brought new coins. Or customer's at all. 

Colbac had slid down the retail ladder. He purveyed goods of the highest quality for the most discerning of customers. But now he had become a purveyor, a mere outfitter. 

A powerful wizard had taken up residence in an abandoned mine to the North. This, in itself, was not the tragedy.

He gives the kid a sword.

He takes the kid with him.


In the middle of everything there is a small kingdom known as Robrecht. That it is a very small Kingdom is a fact often overlooked by the history book, as it is a place which gained much of it's importance from it's placement. It is in the middle of the continent, in the middle of a mountain range -- in fact, it even got started in the middle of a river. 

But that is a story for another time, what is important right now is that Robrecht (pronounced Raw-brecht) is even the middle of a mess.  

02.5-The-Party




The sign proclaimed to all who passed that this was the Inn of the Bent Eelpout (a very ugly kind of fish) but since there was only one Inn left in the troubled Town of Robrecht, everyone just called it the Inn.

Inside a group of adventurers had congealed around a table. At first, it had not been clear that they were, in fact, adventurers. They was always the outside chance that they were pilgrims, or merchants who had some how made it through the trouble and chaos on the roads. Even these dark days, such things were not unheard of. 

Asarah, the Innkeeper, had been thrown off by the fact that there was, at first, only two of them. And they had paid for their lunch. This was a welcome change. There had been too many empty beds, too many kegs of ale going dead before they were finished. The Inn had fallen on hard times. 

There

The trouble started, as it usually does, after the third pint of ale.


 were too many empty beds, too many




 The proprietoress eyed them warily. Adventurers, it is is well known in the inn-keeping trade, can be hard on the furniture, and like as not, penniless.  



The door to the Inn banged shut. On the other side of it. 

Asarah knew they were trouble from the moment they walked in. 

It was in the slow hours of the afternoon. 

They had come in earlier in the day. 



Mephisto - Mage ** chosen one
Gwendolyn - Healer
Taran - Fighter ** chosen one
Alderbourg -- Ranger


"But I am the chosen one!" proclaimed the man in a mail shirt so cheap the rings were large enough to poke a sword through. 

"HOW DARE YOU!" shouted the man in the midnight blue Mage Robes, "You are merely a brute. A swinger of heavy implements. A bleeder of common blood. Chosen, perhaps, to carry my bags. But nothing more."

"C'mon, guys, calm down," said the bored looking man dressed in Lincoln Green. "We're all on the same side here." He was clearly a Ranger, and the only member of the party who had seen action

"Yes, please," implored the stocky woman who wore white and smelled of incense. "The true chosen one is has not been chosen to spread discord, but rather to spread concord and peace throughout the land."

"SHUT UP!" both of the "chosen ones" snapped at the healer. Who stuck her lower lip out and turned her offended sensibilities towards the wall so that no one could the tears welling up in her eyes. 

The mage looked on the fighter with disdain. "How dare you talk to her that way. She is a priestess in the Holy Order of..."

"But, but, but, you..."

"Yes, words fail you, often don't they. The blood that flows through your veins is coarse and common."

"Oh yeah," said the fighter as he grabbed the hilt of his sword and pulled, "And what kind of blood do you bleed? Chosen blood?"

"You dare to trifle with the great Mephisto!" shouted the Mage. He barked a word in the old speech and gestured with his hands. The fighter's half unsheathed sword froze in it's scabbard, and no matter how hard he pulled, he could not budge it another inch. 

"Oh, son of a whore. Now you are going to pay." The fighter advanced on the Mage meaning to tear him limb from limb with his bare hands. But he found that his right hand would not unwrap from the sword. With his right arm trapped across his body, he moved awkwardly and found it difficult to use his left hand. With his free arm, he lunged at the Mage.

The Mage dodged out of the way with a high-pitched laugh that sounded like the noise a small woodland creature would make when something unseemly was done to it. 

"You cannot defeat the chosen one," cried the Mage as he poured a tankard of ale over the fighter's head. "Peace, brothers, peace" cried the Healer, "We are all on the same side," she finished without much conviction. 

"SHUT UP!" They both cried, and then resumed their confrontation. 

In his flailing struggles to free his arm, the fighter tripped over a chair leg and knocked the entire contents into the healer's lap. Drenched in beer, and pinned against the sooty wall of the tavern, she reached her breaking point. She looked down upon her temple robes, the sign of her profession, great purity, devotion to the continued sustenance of all life on Earth and the obscene amount of time she spent keeping them clean and free of stains. They were covered with mutton grease, red wine, mead and the yeasty trails of the Inn's red Ale. 

"THAT'S IT!" She shrieked. The whole room froze.

He looks like he's about ready to ride his horse into a low-hanging tree. 

Oh those lot don't have horses. In fact, I'm a little bit worried about them having enough for the tab.

Cut them off then.

No, no, no, she said in a kind way that was largely inappropriate for an Innkeeper. 

Boltac heaved his bulk up out of the chair and took a firm grip on his walking stick, "Well, if you won't, then I'm happy to."

"No, sweet friend, I don't want any trouble."

"Trouble? From them?" asked Boltac 

For the first time, Asarah saw a glint in the merchant's eye that gave her pause. "No, please, I don't want to have to pay for the breakage," she said.

"Hmm," said Boltac, shrinking back into himself, "Makes sense. Have I ever told you about the coin in my floor?"

"Only every single time you come in here you sad..." she began, not unkindly, but was unable to finish because of a gigantic whooshing sound as the Mage lost control of his fireball spell and the far side of the common room was enveloped in flames. 

With a gigantic whoosh, the other side of the room went up in flames as the Mage lost control of his fireball spell. In his defense, he wasn't completely incompetent. His concentration had slipped because the healer had his him over the back of the head with a chair. 

"Oh dear," she said, as she watched the fire leap across the dry wood.  



----

Set up Boltac talking to the wizard. 

Have the wizard secretly cast a spell to quench the fire.

[when they face the troll, the mage tries the spell and it doesn't work. He and the fighter look at each other -- "It was supposed to work." 

"You're an asshole," said the fighter. Then the troll crushed him to the earth with one massive arm. The healer began screaming.

# Chapter 2 -- The Eelpout/Homely Inn

### *Write from Asarah's point of view*

Who is this broad anyway?

What is the conflict in this chapter?

Asarah v. table -- She knows they aren't going to pay. 

Boltac v Oddna for Asarah's attention. <== can we do this from Asarah's point of view?





What does this chapter need to do?

1. set up Asarah
2. set up the party
3. Introduce Oddna?
4. add to the elegiac tone of a city under siege?

Beats of Homely Inn

Asarah and Boltac flirt. 

The heroes are jerks- grab her ass

Oddna chimes in. She is a beautiful woman

Asarah sighed and raked her hand through her long dark hair. From the professional side of the bar, she surveyed the Inn's common room. A fire crackled happily in the fieldstone fireplace, a gentleman nursed an ale on the far end of the bar and the assholes in the far corner laughed too loud and too long for a Inn and whole city that was slowly going out of business. 

There were a few local's here for dinner, but none of the traders that had been the mainstay of her business. All it had taken was 

And the the Adventurer's showed up. 

Merchants and trading caravans were good business. They came through regularly, they did good for the people in town by bringing them trade goos and, most importantly, they had coin with which to pay.

It was, her husband, Barovold had told her, the best place in the four Kingdoms to have an in. 

Barovold had come from a long line of innkeepers  




---


Instead of returning to the store, he trudged into the inn.

Smell of wood smoke, roasting meat and fine ale wrapped his senses in a comforting hug. On the left was a bar running the length of the building. To the left a common room with tables. Mostly empty now, given the hour of the day and the state of the town. But in the far corner, five people sat at one of the large round tables and clanked there tankards together. 

"Huzzah," they cried, "To us, the conquering heroes!"

Gah, thought Boltac, more adventurers. Mithras save us from this plague of adventurers. They had little enough money when the descended upon the town, but after they drank what little they came with they either made an ill-advised

Hero, thought Boltac, was just another word for a misfit who couldn't find a honest purpose in the world. He had known fighters in his time, some of them good. But all of the real ones had fought for loyalty or a steady paycheck. And these creatures, that drank and boasted in taverns, while they worked up the nerve -- who's bodies littered the countryside, dismembered in terrible and remarkable ways. Who only served to aggravate the Dread Wizard Oddna -- and really was he Dread? Maybe he just wanted to be left alone. To forget his past in where ever it was he came from -- that was a good a reason as any to come to the mountains of High Robrecht.

----

He bellied up to the well-worn bar. The 


----

Goes to bar. Asks asarah is he can borrow an ale. 

"I hate to think what condition you'll give it back to me." She quipped. And the. She smiled. And just like that, gravity was a little lighter and he forgot the problems of the world for a little while. 

"Don't worry, it will be liquid."

And then, miracle of miracles, she laughed.  She she shook her head and as he long black hair rippled like waves through the water the crusty old merchant melted and for just a second you could see the little boy inside. 

Then she broke the spell by asking, "but seriously 'Tac" what's gotten into you?"

"Oh, he said, running a hand through his thinning hair in frustration, "this kid just came into my store asking to borrow a sword."

What? You mean like you'd borrow a cup of sugar. 

Yes, exactly. Except when you borrow a cup of sugar, you don't go off and use it to get yourself kills trying to save some damn fool... 
What?

Priestess of Dar. 

"Oh, virgin love," she said with a look in her eye that made Boltac realize, telling the truth about the less than virginal priestess was the wrong thing to do. 

"Hmmm," he said into his beer. 

"So, did you loan him the sword?"

"No," snapped Boltac, foam flying from his lips. "I hit him over the head with a club, dragged him across the street and left him unconscious on the bench out front."

Now her eyes flashed dark against the wave of her hair. "How *could* you?" 

"It was easy, actually, I just took my..." he trailed off, realizing that he just waded too deeply into the wrong answer. It did not pay to upset the only licensed provider of ale for 10 miles around, so he tried again. "Look, woman," realizing that he had gone even farther wrong as he said it, "What do you think monsters in that dungeon would have done to him. It's no pink tea you know. "




"Wouldn't you go?"


"No I wouldn't"



"And you *do* realize what it means?" she asked, laughing at him. 

Boltac didn't say anything. He looked away and his eyes unfocused as the memories tried to come flooding back. He took a long pull on the ale, gulping down nearly half of it. 




---

Asarah -- but you see that's how she knows he loves her. He comes for her, risks everything against all odds for the love of his life. 

Boltac -- that's how she knows he's an idiot. 

Asarah -- You're a bitter, bitter man. 

Boltac -- What because I make good sense?

Asarah -- Because there's no romance in your life. No passion. No magic. 

Ugh, thought Boltac. Magic that's worse than romance


* She gives him a bit of handkerchief and lace to see if he can find more of it. He set's it as a favor on his helmet. (the ugliest helmet anyone had ever seen. That has a powerful magical ability, uniquely suited to Boltacs unusual (well unusual for an adventurer) skills.


---


-Isn't that right, Asarah?" but when he turned back, she was gone.

---

"She is a fine woman," said the man sitting two seats away at the bar. 

"Hunrn," grunted Boltac, for all the sentiment that gave away. When he turned he saw that the speaker was dressed in an expensive black fabric, with a sash of red as counter point to a fancy gentleman's sword with a brilliant red jewel in the hilt. He had the look of money about him. Boltac didn't remember seeing him when he came in. 

<!-- "Someone should do something about such adventurers," said Boltac, they are a plague on commerce and the commonwealth alike."

"Perhaps someone will," ventured the stranger, somewhat cryptically." 
 -->





Let Asarah and Boltac fight before she is kidnapped. 

Boltac leaves to summon the guard. 

He goes to collect Asarah, but she won't come. He curses her as a fool. She throws a knife at him. Sticks in the wall. 

Fine -- be independent. 

Why? Who's going to take care of me? You? Ha hahaha, Romantic Boltac? 






As soon as Boltac exited the Inn, he cried out, "Watchman! Where is the Watch?" no answer came from the darkness of the street. It should be -- oh, what was his name -- that kid from Egretia, to the West. The one who always came in to pine over some bauble that he could not afford for some girl back home who had surely abandoned him the moment he left home to seek his fortune. Lad's these days, observed Boltac, they had no idea of how the world really worked. 

He started towards the gate, crying, "Watchman! Watchman," as he went. As he went, here and there curious faces poked out of windows at him. "Nothing to be concerned about, just a fight at the tavern." Most of the houses were empty, but such common folk as remained in Robrecht, nodded or closed the shutters or rolled their eyes before returning to their dinner. Good people, thought Boltac, who practicing a trade or a craft, worked to raise a family and just wanted to be left alone. 

They deserved better than the city's fate. This slow decent into disolution. 

In a few minutes, he reached the South Gate. When he saw that the walls were unguarded, he assumed they were in the guardhouse, sharing a bottle or dicing the long dull hours of the night's watch away. "Hullo the guardhouse," he cried. His voice echoed off the flagstones in the silence that followed. The gate was open. And unguarded. 

Boltac moved faster now. His step became lighter and his movements more sure. He threw open the door to the guardhouse. Inside things were a jumble. A few pieces of charcoal burned in the grate. The Duke's guard must have left within the hour. Two at most. Damnably odd. And... disturbing. 

Perhaps it was nothing, but Boltac closed and barred the gate. Moving the heavy timbers of the gate was a job for two or three men, but he bent to it and grunted as his feel slipped and scrabbled for purchase among the well-trod cobbles. The cords in his neck pulled tight, a vein in his forehead pulsed. Shoving as hard as he could, he got the hinges to admit a groan of defeat as the gate moved, inch by inch into the closed position. He shot the heavy bolt home, wishing for some reason, that he should go back and take the charm of shutting that protected his own store. Use what power he could to protect the city. 

Of course this was nonsense? Who would attack a poor city in the middle of nowhere? There was no profit in it. And if an army advanced on Robrecht, surely the prices of things would have gone up. There would have been spies, strangers passing through in odd rainment who... His thoughts leapt to Asarah and the man in black who sat at her bar and paid her compliments.

To go directly to the keep and warn the men there, or to go first to the Inn and warn Asarah. To save her? Ah, but she did not want saving, at least that's what she said. 

He turned and trudged up the hill towards the Keep and Tower that rose from the roaring gorge that split the town in two. As he climbed the steep and winding streets, his head grew light and he couldn't breathe fast enough. He felt old. As if the spring had gone out of his legs and the pillow out of his lungs. Too much standing behind a counter had made him soft, when once he had been young and ranging. As tireless as a hound and as quick as... well he had thought he was. Life had proved him wrong, in the end. 

He stopped at the bridge to catch his breath. The wood structure arched high over the deep gorge to the spire of rock beyond. It had been constructed by the same skilled craftsmen that chained the wooden roadways to the most precarious mountain defiles. Just wide enough for two wagons to pass, they were. Men and goods were often lost in the most difficult part of the passage. 

On the road, one didn't have much of a chance to notice, but here a man who was afraid of heights had time to see the whole thing. Upriver was the gigantic waterfall where Lake Halikai poured into the gorge to start the River Swift. Below, the river was lost in the clouds of roiling fog that gave the Tower of Mists it's name. The far off thunder of a mighty river pounding against the central spire of rock upon which the Tower walls rested, sounded far off doom, as one considered the empty air under the thin boards that made up the bridge. 

Perhaps these boards had been too long in the damp? Who knew which one had rotted away, and under which foot this disintegration would be revealed? Boltac would have been more reassured with a bridge of stone, but he recognized that for centuries, this jutting finger or rock in the middle of the river cut gorge had been the safety and stronghold of the the city of Robrecht. Invaders had looted and pillaged the city that lay on both the North and the South sides of the River the town, but no siege had ever been successful in crossing the gorge between. And if trouble come again, the bridges would be covered in pitch and set afire by the watch after the city had pulled back into the Tower. 

Or they would, if the Duke's guards had been there. As he crossed the bridge, Boltac forgot his fear of heights, for a new fear tickled the hair on his neck. "Where were the guards."

The Tower door stood open. Where had everyone gone? Boltac looked behind him. In the moonlight, he could see that no one was in evidence on the southern road. If the Duke had fled the city with his household, wouldn't someone have heard, or seen them? Rumor would have had to have reached the Inn, wouldn't it? 

He climbed the wide steps, expect a challenging cry to come forth from the arrowslits at any moment. Boltact knew the door would be locked -- with no guard, how could it not be -- but it was open. The strong place at the heart of the city was left unguarded?

His footsteps rang out against the stone as he walked through the great hall alone. The tapestry that hung from the wall behind th




Boltac stood in an empty throne room. Actually, it was worse than empty, from all outward signs it had been hastily abandoned. 

The cushion was missing from the large walnut chair that served as, well throne, was perhaps too generous of a term. The chair in the raised place that let everyone else in the room know that the person who sat here was someone not to be trifled with. Someone who, no matter how small the Kingdom, or Dutchy (depending on the day) of Robrecht might appear to be to the casual observer 

Someone had even tried to take the ornate tapestry that covered the west wall of room. Most of it was a ripped off the wall and in hung by only a handful of attachment points. He imagined a poor servant, perhaps the last man out, scared out his his mind, the last man to flee, pulling frantically on a corner of the great tapestry. 

Perhaps he thought he could sell

But no one sat in the Seat. There was no justice in Robrecht. 




Yes, politics was always in flux in Robrecht. It was the only place Boltac had ever heard of that manage to be simultaneously at the middle of everything and a long way away from anywhere. But still, this was a bit much. 

So the Duke had run away, and his entire household with him. This boded not well for the smallfolk of Robrecht. Of course the Duke

"We deserve better than this," muttered Boltac. There was a whistling noise, and Boltac watched fog blow through the room and disappear into the tapestry.  

Hmm, thought Boltac, not failed theft, but rather failed deception. He brushed the remnant of Robrecht's heroic and probably false past aside to reveal a secret door set in the stone. The heavy stone door swung noislessly on well-crafted hinges with the movement of the air through. Only the torn tapestry had prevented it from closing. 

So that's where they went. He hadn't know that there had been a secret way out of the [misty tower.] A handy thing to to know. And an even handier thing to keep you yourself. 

For a moment, Boltac thought about descending. About leaving the whole mess behind him. Sure he would lose his inventory, but it wasn't like the store was selling much. On top of which, now that the Duke was gone, Boltac's monopoly was by no means a sure thing. Whether he wanted to go out of business or not, it looked like that would happen. 

But no. There might be a time to give up hope, but it was not yet. "Not yet," he said aloud to the empty room, as if trying to convince himself.

# The Assault

Boltac hurried across the South Bridge

Boltac curses -- where were those adventurers now? Now that there was plenty of adventure to be had.

Bridges have names. ---

For centuries, travelers and traders have trod this path until it has wound it's way through the thick forest like a handcrafted thing. 

----
Rattick really should have put that Troll on the payroll. There were only two obstacles to that line of thinking. 1. Rattick never parted with a coin he didn't have to. 2. Talking to Trolls is exceedingly hazardous to your health. And Rattick, as he was fond of saying, didn't stick his neck out for nobody. 

Academically he could understand how sad it was that three brave, if naive, underprepared and very stupid adventurers had just been turned into a fine red paste by the angry troll that lurked in the back of the first level.

---

After the fight died down, and all the parties had been thrown out in the street. Rattick made his move. He sidled up to the party and said, "You know, I wasn't going to join you, but after seeing the ferocity and prowess"

"Our cause?" asked one of the chosen ones, still feeling the effects of his recent concussion. 

"Yes, to rid the world of great evil,"

"And win fame and fortune, don't forget that part," said the young girl with the Raven hair and the chip on her shoulder. 

"Oh, of course, I would never forget that," he said, "But it is important for you to know that my motivation is much, much deeper than that," Rattick said with all the sincerity he could manufacture. Rattick loved lying. It was, after all, stealing. And stealing nothing less than the truth.

Boltac until he decides to go on his quest, has flashback and wakes up. 

Rattick telling the story of Boltac until they get to Oddna.

Rattick betrays Boltac to the wizard. Boltac is thrown into the deepest pits of the dungeon. Boltac can uphold his code. 

He is seized, they drag him before Oddna. he tries to negotiate for the woman -- she gets upset because he's buying her (like a slave) he confesses his love. 

Oddna mocks the woman -- she's the sandwich wench. How sad that you are in love with the Sandwich wench. 

She looked hurt, but to Boltac's eyes, he had never seen her look so beautiful before. I have made you an offer, do you decline

Oddna throws it open to the room -- to his boys. They all laugh at Boltac. For coming here. For thinking he would get away with this with his life. You've been making a living off all of my fallen children. In essence, paying people to come kill them for their posessions and their teeth -- in once instance for their body parts. Do you know in the far southern reaches of _______________ Orc Pizzle is believed to be an aphrodesiac. 

Really, Orc Pizzle. 

Yes, they dry it, grind it up into a powder and make it into a tonic.

part two -- Oddna (if that is his name.)

Set up the bit about summoning the essence of magic to this world. Able to control it. To tap into the purest source.  

He has matured. First he made trinkets. Second he made life. Now he has gone to the source of all his power. It was a fine progression for a wizard. 

He has the innkeeper working for him. (I'm not going to have your children _- don't be rediculous. these are all my children. I made them.)

Chapter Intros

"In his youth, he swung a wooden sword and though himself safe as he boasted of conquests he had yet to make. But no man can pray to the goddess Adventure without consequence. When she called, he was fool enough to answer. His lust for plunder and glory left him penniless, friendless and lame. A hero no longer, he apprenticed with a shop keeper. He learned the ways of bargain and barter. Came to judge the worth of things and men. In time, he made what peace he could and forgot Adventure. He decided he was not Chosen. Not Destined to wear a jeweled crown upon a troubled brow. 

Adventure had slightly different ideas on the subject."





Boltac swept the front of the door clean. He limped along the cobblestones, swinging the broom with great vigor. The dust and filth of the street bounced down the hill in a small avalanche. It was good not to live at the bottom of the hill. 

When he was done he hitched his belt up underneath his round belly and surveyed the day. Business has been poor of late, something to do with politics -- politics always played hell with trade -- but Boltac was not worried. The sign over the store read M. Boltac, General Outfitter and Purveyor of Fine Items Infused with Mystical Properties and Magickal Energies. His barrel chest swelled with pride as he looked at his sign in the morning light. It had cost a pretty penny. Fourteen words was more that the sign painter had ever put one sign. 

Boltac thought is spoke of substance and bespoke class and sophistication. It certainly impressed the customers. "General Outfitter, Purveyor of Fine Items," he whispered. Times were always good for a General Outfitter you see, because a General Outfitter sold whatever people needed. Setting out to save a Princess, see the outfitter. Looking for something with which to destroy a loathsome Troll? See the Outfitter. As Boltac was fond of saying, "Great deeds are not accomplished without adequate provisions."

Commerce and Adventure



Between the time when the oceans drank Atlantis, and the rise of the sons of Aryas, there was an age undreamed of. And onto this, Conan, destined to wear the jeweled crown of Aquilonia upon a troubled brow. It is I, his chronicler, who alone can tell thee of his saga. Let me tell you of the days of high adventure!


He did not care any more... life and death... the same. Only that the crowd would be there to greet him with howls of lust and fury. He began to realize his sense of worth... he mattered. In time, his victories could not easily be counted... he was taken to the east, a great prize, where the war masters would teach him the deepest secrets. Language and writing were also made available, the poetry of Kitai, the philosophy of Sung; and he also came to know the pleasures of women, when he was bred to the finest stock. But, always, there remained the discipline of steel.
The children of Doom...Doom's children. They told my lord the way to the Mountain of Power. They told him to throw down his sword and return to the earth. Hah! Time enough for the earth in the grave.
All manner of pleasures and diversions were indulged. Wealth can be wonderful, but you know - success can test one's mettle as surely as the strongest adversary.

{Add river pouring out out of the lake.}

Robrecht was a city that had grown up around a place of fortitude. It was one of the great paradoxes that a city that was seemingly in the middle of nowhere could be at the crossroads of everywhere. And while it was lonely and remote, it had always been plagued by raiders and bandits and generals at the head of armies on their way to conquer somewhere bigger and with more resources but who figured, "Eh, while we are here," we might as well soak up this little place. 

As a result, Robrecht had developed some very interesting coping mechanisms. First, the citizens had no illusions about kings or crowns or cults or any such thing. Their allegiance was to themselves and their neighbors. And against any tax collector of any shape or size anywhere. In fact, the Robrechtians (seldom, if ever called that due to the awkwardness of the term) were famous for their apparent poverty amid great wealth. They had it, for sure. 

As the citizens were realists, the city would allow itself be conquered at the drop of a hat. Only after the invading army had let down it's guard, installed it's local officials and had sent the soldiers away, would they commence to fighting. 

Some of the resistance was passive. Not so much a refusal to collect taxes, but a general incompetence at it. "I'm sorry Guv, there's been so many different people with their hands in the pot, I forget what gets taxed and what doesn't." And who could blame them. The average amount of time any one flag flew over the city was about five years. 

Some of the resistance, however, was active. And the design of the city itself seemed to support this. Winding, inconsistently named streets that folded back in upon themselves with neither rhyme nor reason. Brain a guardsmen with a paving stone and you disappear into the winding, misty streets before the watch knew what happened. In fact, if you weren't born and raised in this strange, bifurcated city, you stood virtually no chance of chasing down a native on foot. 
So it was that invading policeman grew fond of heavy helmets and tolerant of local customs. 

The city itself was split into two halves. In the distant, storied past, there had been two towns, Ro and Brecht. Each on it's own side of the deep chasm cut by the river Swift as it thundered down from the high mountains and into the capacious plains of the Southern Kingdoms. And while they were separated by the river, the were drawn together by the bridge. Or rather, bridges. 

You see, in the middle of the chasm there was an island of rock too hard to be washed away by the River Swift. For centuries the river had tried. And the battle between the seemingly impervious stone and the certainly unstoppable river had waged longer then the memory of man. At the center of the city was constant roaring noise and a cloud of mist. 

So a bridge was built from the east and bridge was built from the west. Initially, the inhabitants of Ro and Brecht only met in the middle to fight. Then to trade. Then, when faced with external mauraders

The Troll had ingested three normal-sized humans, and as such, was a little bloated. He dragged himself along the dark stone hallway as best he could, but the strain in his abdominal muscles and the inherent sleepiness that comes after a heavy meal, slowed him greatly. The bump in his distended, warty stomach was so big that he had to move his left hip around lunch, rather than walking straight through the natural arc of motion. 

A few minutes into his retreat into darkness, he began to feel a nauseous. That always happened when he ate too fast. The strips of leather kit and armor never agreed with him. Many of his relatives thought him weak, but none of them had ever accidentally eaten and passed a codpiece. 

The Troll grabbed the stitch in his side and thought eagerly of this bed that lay but three levels below in the catacombs. When the TROLL had moved in, this had once a thriving district. But since then much of the dungeon had moved away -- and more of it had fallen into decline.

The entrance to the Wizard's lair was three days into the mountain. As he walked up into the mountains, the years fell off him. By the second day his limp had disappeared and he felt better than he had felt in ages. He thought his body had grown infirm from the weight of the years, but it weak and pained from neglect rather than strain.

He bent to drink in a mountain stream and felt something wild stirring within him. He was unfettered, free. And not in the least because he believed himself going to his own death. But he was going as a free man, unencumbered. He was somewhat ashamed to admit, for all the disdain he had heaped on others, on an *adventure*.

Historically, the ruler of the land called Robrecht had two choices. First, to declare himself a king and then in some way or another fight all four neighboring kingdoms. Or take the more humble title of Duke and then declare allegiance to one or more of the four neighboring kingdoms -- thus gaining support against the others, and fighting less. 

It was a tenous position in the best of times, but when the fucking wizard showed up -- forget about it.

## Chapter 1

Colbac was eating a mutton sandwich from the Inn across the street. The Inn, which was the only Inn in town, in the same way that Colbac's was the only store in town, was justly famous for a full range of mutton dishes. Quite improbably these included a  mutton tort with a honey glaze that was one of the chief reasons Colbac was as wide as he was tall. Well, that and the Ale. 

Colbac lifted a tankard of the good red ale and washed down a mouthful of greasy meat. There was a time when he would not have eaten and drank alone at the end of a working day. He would have come out from behind his thick oak counter, flipped the sign in the window, activated the charm of warding and gone across the street to sit by the roaring fire, eat, drink and otherwise be merry. But those days were past. Now Colbac opened early and closed late. And the only time he saw a serving wench was when she brought him dinner. 
It was the adventurer's who had ruined it all. This had been such a nice town. Colbac had had such a nice store. But when a foul and black-hearted wizard had taken up residence in a nearby complex of underground caverns, things had started to turn. 

A wizard was bad enough, what with the destruction of crops, the mutilation of cattle, the disruption of weather patterns, the disappearance of virgins... a whole host and swarm of villainies were blamed on the nearby wizard. 

At first, Colbac suspected that the wizard might have been little more than a convenient scapegoat for the troubles of the simple-minded villagers. But as time passed, he realized that he had been wrong. Every Wizard worth his salt has a gimmick, you see. A signature theme to the magic that he does. Many great and powerful wizards have never amounted to much in the wizarding world because they could never find a proper of consistent theme for their oveure. 

For example, Venario, an enchanter who had installed himself in a tower far to the North, had found a theme in his strange and sinister sense of humor. He created some of the finest magical items the world had ever known, but the power and perfection of his enchantments were each directed into a completely counter-productive, ironic and often embarrassing purpose. 

It was not enough for the Great Giambanista Venario to cause a sword to be less likely to cut it's foe or an arrow to be less likely to find it's mark. God's no! That was the stuff of village witches. Merely parlor tricks compared to the great body of work that Venario had dedicated his life to enchanting. 

The new Wizard had taken an unusual and fairly destructive theme. He was a breeder, keeper and trainer of all kind of creatures. In his massive underground lair he kept a managerie of such variety and horror that, in the end, all the blame heaped on his name turned out to be deserve. Never let it be said, that Oddna didn't earn his terrible reputation.

But as bad as Oddna was, he was less damaging to the town than the plague of adventurers who descended upon it. They ruined the pleasant life in the otherwise quiet town. And they angered the wizard and his minons with their countless, pointless, hopeless forays into the Wizard's demesne. 

Angry minions, of course, lash out in greater and greater numbers for greater distances. Which, of course, calls forth bigger idiots who imagined themselves bigger heroes. The whole thing escalated in a vicious cycle until all of the outlying villages has been raised. 

Of course, the other townspeople didn't see it that way. They thought themselves beset upon by great an sinister forces. And those who came to aid the town in it's time of trial were great heroes. They were to be toasted, to be fete'd to be treated as the last great hope for the redemption of the town. No matter that what few virgins were left in the vicinity disappeared at an alarming rate. No matter that each party that set out, no matter how promising they seemed, they all met with slaughter. 

One night, deep in his cups, Borlag, the innkeeper had confided in him, "It's not like "

Colbac found the whole thing ghoulish. 

But of course that wasn't the real reason  <!-- Leave this as the hook for the story of the young girl. Colbac had once been a fighter, but he had been lamed by a  -->

And it didn't hurt that they were such a stimulus to the local economy. The Innkeeper, Borlag, grew fat and rich off his sale of fermented grain. He even changed the name of the place from "The Flaming Sparrow", to "The Adventurer's Inn". 

All of this was good for Colbac's business, but bad for his soul. Everyday he saw 

Why no one commented


As much as he hated them, they had been great for Colbac's business

<!-- 
Colbac had a special grudge against Venario, and knew his work better than anyone else in the kingdom. As the only outfitter for miles around, Colbac had outfitted every party of adventurers who had gone looking for glory, riches and trouble for as long as anyone could remember. Mostly, the adventurers found trouble. Even when they thought they had found riches. 
 -->

Halfway through his sandwich, the bell on the door rang, signifying that a customer had entered. Colbac grumbled through his dinner, washed it down with a swig of ale and mustered his signature brand of customer service.

"What do you want?" he demanded of the poor specimen who now clogged his showroom. 

"Please sir," the man in the cheap armor began.

Colbac held up a hand and said, "No."

"But you don't even know what I am going to ask."

"And I don't want to know. Do you see that?" He pointed at a sign on the wall that read, "No Discounts"

"I can't read..." said the young man, looking at the floor awkwardly.

"'Course not," said Colbac, "and why should you put the effort into acquiring such a useless skill?"

The young, almost-fighter ventured a half-smile. 

Colbac was not charmed. "I mean, wearing armor like that, you're life expectancy isn't long enough to finish a magazine, let alone a proper book."

"Pleas sir," the young fighter tried, attempting to make up with perseverance what he lacked in rhetorical skill. 

"Boy, go back to you your hovel," said Colbac.

"But, I need to borrow a sword, sir. Just for a day or so."

"BORROW? A SWORD!" Colbac said in such a voice as to make the strong, but poorly equipped young man flinch. 

"Y-y-y-yes sir. It's so I can rescue the love of my life."

"Oh well, that changes everything," said Colbac, as his face grew hard in the harsh light of his cheap torches. "Tell me more," he said, as if it was a dare.

"Well sir, she is a priestess of Dar. And, well,"

"Aren't they supposed to be virgins? Them priestesses of Dar."

The young man blushed and said, "WIt's more of a suggestion, than a rule, sir. If you know what I mean," his face grew serious, "but if it helps, I was a virgin, if you catch my drift."

"Help? How would that help?"

"She's gone and got herself into trouble. In the underkeep I mean. And if I had a sword, I could go and rescue her."

"Oh lad, if you had a sword, I'm sure you could. In fact, a big strong lad like yourself could probably manage it with your bare hands."

The boy looked shocked, "No sir, I could never..."

"Well, then, I suggest you find yourself another Priestess of the Eternal Flame of Questionable virtue."

"What are you saying. Look, if you are insulting the virtue of my young--"

Colbac slammed a club of knotty wood down upon his counter. "You'll WHAT?" he asked with great relish? Hoping the boy would do something stupid so that he could vent his spleen. 

In a quiet voice the lad said, "I'm not asking for a discount. It's just a loan."

"It's the worst kind of discount of all," shrieked Colbac, "It's a 100% discount."

"But I'd bring it back. Maybe with a few nicks, but definitely covered in glory."

"Oh Glory is it? That would enhance the retail value."

"Yes, yes," he said eagerly, unaware of the trap he was falling into. 

"Because you are such a great fighter."

"Yes, that's it."

"Powerful, strong," Colbac prompted.

"Yes."

"Well then, how about this?" Colbac slowly lifted the club off of his counter and held it above his head. He watched as the young "fighter's" trusting, cow-like eyes followed the weapons movement. Then, without the any hesitation of remorse or conscience, he dropped the heavy, burlwood shaft down on the top of his unarmored head. 
. 

As the lad collapsed to the floor unconscious, Colbac felt secure in the knowledge that he had done him a favor as well as a concussion. 

No, thought Colbac, you're no kind of fighter at all. Too earnest. Too willing to play by the rules. You won fights by cheating. And heroes cheated more than anybody. No, the young lad was better off unconscious, at least he wouldn't get his fool self killed by running off in the the dungeon. 

Colbac came out from behind his counter and dragged the boy outside. By the scruff of his neck. Colbac was not pretty, he was not graceful, but he was strong. He dragged the lad across the street and propped him up next to a drunk who was sitting on the bench in front of the Inn. Ah, what adventuring lies they would tell each other when they woke up. 

His good deed done for the day, Colbac rubbed his mouth and decided he had earned another tankard of ale. He steeled his nerve and pushed though the door of the inn. 

The inside was dark and smokey. The smells of beer and body odor jockeyed for position in Colbac's nostrils. In spite of himself, he winced. As his eyes adjusted to the darkness of the common room, he saw a band of adventurers he had not yet seen begging for change around the town. Adventurer, of course, was a polite synonym for broke with no prospects of employment. 

In the far corner of the room, Shanallanon, the local excuse for a bard was doing


Ah, Ethline, you're a sight for parched eyes. When are you going to come to your senses and get rid of the vagrants so we can enjoy our quiet talks together."

"And, by quiet talks you'd mean you sitting on a stool, muttering into your pint why I "

"As long as they've got coin."

"Yes, as long as they've the coin," she conceded.

"Which, judging by the poor quality of their equipage, shouldn't be but for one or two more rounds."

"Oh, leave them be. They're young and off in search of adventure. Besides, you're just jealous."

This turn of conversation made Colbac nervous, and he attempted to head it off by saying, "Another pint of the Red, if you please."

"Yes, no denying it Colbac. D'ye remember when you went forth in search of adventure."


"When are you going to come to your senses and make an honest woman of me?" she teased back. It was

into the middle of the street. Someone would drag him off to the Temple soon enough. And who knew, perhaps another pretty Priest or Priestess would take an interest (or pity) in him. 


As Colbac waddled back into his store with all the grace of a hermit crab claiming a new home. He turned in the door way and then glared out into the early evening, as if daring any other adventurer to darken his doorway. From across the dirt road he heard laughter from the inn. His face twisted into a scowl as he thought of them in there. The boastful and the proud. The pretty and the brave. The one's who thought they were heroes in the making, but would all, sooner or later, wind up in Colbac's shop, broken and broke, asking for money. 

Please sir, they would all say, just a little bit more for this amulet, can't yous see the magic in it. I just need a little more to pay a healer to deal with this salamander bite. 

Colbac slammed the door as hard as he could. The panes of glass in his shop window rattled perilously but they held. 

He rubbed his leg again. These were the last days of summer and already he could feel the Winter's storms approaching in his hip. He settled back onto his stool and had a sip of beer. 

For a while, he stared at the door, as if daring the world to send another customer. But then his gaze wandered around his shop. To Colbac, of course, it was nothing special. It was his home and his store room all rolled into one. But for those broke and struggling adventurers across the street, Colbac's shop seemed a treasure trove. 
Here were enchanted Mage Robes that were stronger than steel. Heavy plate armor that not even a dragon's breath could melt. There were weapons of every imaginable size and quality. But the finest (displayed in the magically sealed case behind the counter)


---

"Hullo!" said a rather dull-faced peasant boy who looked like he had been raised on a diet of oats and hard work. Innocence and honesty  did not make sense to Colbac, so he distrusted him immediately. 


---

Colbac was a shop keeper, but in a special kind of shop. You, of course, are accustomed to shops where the owner or the employees are eager to see you, willing to help and unfailingly polite. The maxim, "The Customer is Always Right" is never far from the modern storeclerk's mind. But Colbac had no employees. And his clientle was very, very different. 

If Colbac had gone in for slogans or clever sayings, if even the first business book had been made available to him, he would have had one phrase knitted on a sampler and hung on the wall next to the club that he kept in case of "customers" that wanted to "haggle" just a little too hard. 

In courtly cross-stitch it would have said, "The Customer is always trying to screw you, Colbac." Every time he had forgotten this maxim, he had lost money. And once, he had lost part of an ear and all the gold he had in his strongbox. Which, in a full accounting of things, wasn't all that much. Business was never that brisk, and Colbac had never been all that handsome of a man. At times he thought the loss of the ear might have actually improved his appearance. 

Although it had been many, many years since an Ogre had been seen in the Kingdom, Colbac would do in a pinch. In fact, as a schoolboy, the other children, in the cruel thoughtless way of young children, who imagine that they are invincible and no injury can last more than an afternoon, taunted him that he  had teased him that his mother had be

To look at Colbac you would, in your heart, no matter how hard you tried, give some credence to the vile slurs of schoolchildren. To being with, he was lame, nearly bald, stout of chest and round of belly and one eye was larger than another. If you did not have to make a deal with him you could have been fooled into thinking he was dull-witted. But, as a person engaged in commerce, this belief would cost you. 

You see, Colbac was not flee of foot, keen of eye or strong of thew. He had never won a fight

And, in a time when it was not unheard of for peasants to be conscripted just so they could be melted down into rendered fat for the cauldron's of hot oil that were dumped onto those besieging the castle, Colbac was deemed unfit for service. 

Where the was a need for pain and iron, Colbac was there. If you needed a thing, somehow Colbac knew a guy. And for a price, he could get it for you. The world was small enough, the professions were few enough and the cocktail parties rare enough that no one ever asked Colbac, "So, what do you do?" But if they had, he would have shown himself to be one of the few rare men who could  answer, "What do you need done?" and mean it. 


He had started small, with little more than a few rags he found on the corpse of a dead adventurer. These 


Adventurer's had been, as far back as anyone could remember, quite common. There were no shortages of ruins, dungeons and fallen cities in the Kingdom of Gygax, and each one was rumored to have it's great treasure, powerful artifact or beautiful princess in need of rescue.





Most of the other boys he had gone to school with were dead now. There had been, of course, the war with Thrace and the

Thief brings in a gem -- which is a message in a bottle.
She is trying to find him. 

Thief tries to kill him and take his stuff when he goes into the dungeon. 

He takes cursed stuff into the dungeon. Gives a cursed sword to somebody who wants to kill him. The guy is over encumbered and collapses to the ground. Colbac then takes his stuff and leaves him there crushed to the ground. -- at the end of the story he's still crushed to the ground. 


---


He gets the message and what? How much do you need to play up the beginning. 

He knows some regular customers, sure. They all come back in the story -- let's say three of them. 


Nattick -- thief -- brings jewel.

Blastum -- world's worst mage. 

Aurelius -- a real fighter?  

---

[you need to describe this guy]

Picks the gem up with a protective gauntlet -- you can never be too careful. He'd seen what cursed items could do to the unwary. All too well he remembered a man who came in with +4 gauntlets of self-abuse. Oh, sure, he had tried to pass them off as ordinary steel gauntlets. "Just try them on" he said -- but Colbac could see the dark circles under his eyes and read the strain on his face. He knew something was up. 

So he just kept him talking until the terrible nature of the gauntlets revealed themselves. And when they did, the man broke down crying and begged Colbac to help him. Colbact calmly asked if the man had anything to sell that wasn't of negative value. 

When the man said no, Colbac apologized and said he couldn't help him. He wasn't in the charity business. 

As they had this conversation, the metal gauntlets were pawing at the man's crotch. As he explained, with some embarrassment, any moment tha the wasn't actively using his hands, the gauntlets were having his way with him. He allowed that for some, say young boys in the first grasp of puberty, this might be seen as a positive enchantment. But the thing was, they never stopped. And they never let him sleep. 

He knew they were cursed because he could not take them off -- or unequip them as he said. 

Five days he had been trapped in these gauntlets. And he feared if he could not get them off that he would go insane.

Colbac face turned to stone, matchign the stone of his heart when he said, "I cannot help you."

Colbac thought of it now and was glad of every penny he had spent on magic nullifying gloves and curse detecting wands. He had never understood the logic or sanity of magic. How much better off the world of commerce would be without all of it. How much more regular and sane. Ah well, it was here, he thought and so he would arbitrage it as best he could. 

He placed the wand on it's hanger behind the counter. The he stripped off the gloves and placed them in the workbench drawer on the far side of the room. Only then did he return to the gem which remained sitting, defenseless as it were, on his appraisal counter. 

Colbac yawned as he straightened and tidyed his shop. There was little enough to look forward to. Mostly just a good night's sleep between now and tomorrow's work. Perhaps he could stomach the foolish adventurer's at the Tavern long enough to squeeze in a pint and a glance at Lorna's tits. 


It was gem, like any other gem and then it wasn't. He sneered as he watched Nattick go. Wishing, in his blacken'd shopkeepers heart that the door would hit him on the way out. But then he took his magic protective gauntlet off his hand

---

Once upon a time there was shop keeper named Colbac. 

Everyday he bought low and sold high and was generally a miserable heartless bastard who hated everyone and thought that people who went into dungeons were stupid. 

Until one day, a thief came along with a seemingly ordinary jewel. But when Colbac touched it, it turned out to be a telepathic appeal from the long-lost love of his life. The one who had left him so long ago. She reveals that she is trapped in the bottom of the Dungeon of the Crazed Overlord and begs Colbac to rescue her. She knows that she has done him wrong, but she also knows that the Overlord mows down strong men like so many blades of grass and that strength will not save her. She needs cunning and tenacity. And Colbac is the most cunning, ruthless and tenacious man she has ever known. 

Because of this Colbac gathers the creme of his goods (a lifetime of them) and heads into the dungeon.

He runs afoul of Nattick who (true to suspicions, tries to kill him as he goes into the dungeon.)

He meets a very tough enemy who doesn't want to bargain (first sub-boss) Let's him take the sword of encumbrance. 

After that word gets around -- he starts saying, take whatever you like. 

(maybe he goes and gets the gauntlets of self-abuse -- Ouch)

"Yeah, well some day, I'm gonna be my own king. I'm going to get to the bottom of a that damn dungeon. Get that Amulet and then I'm gonna be the most powerful man in the kingom. Marry the princess, become the king!"

"After waiting a respectable amount of time for the current king to pass of natural causes, of course," Colbac said with a wink.

"Well, some causes are more natural than others, if you know what I mean," said Blastum the Almost-Mage.

"Treason! Sedition! Guards!"

And with that the  stone-faced guards came to life and seized the Mage. The young lad screamed and kicked and generally pitched a fit. His spells of little fire danced harmlessly along their chain mail, barely warming the skin. 

"Here, enough of that!" said one of the guards as he slammed a fist into his annoying prisoner. 

As Baltac watched the guards drag him from his shop, Blastum's face, contorted in pain, seemed to say "Maybe I should have been a healer."

When the door had closed, Colbac picked up the multi-faceted jewel and placed it in the display case. Yes, that would fetch a pretty penny. And now he would surely be able to sell it well above his cost. There were many negotiation strategies, and Colbac knew them all.

To his credit, he felt no pangs of remorse at having cause a relatively innocent man to be thrown in the King's Dark Dungeon. If he truly was the greatest Wizard of the Age, he would escape and if not, then it would be better for him to rot in the King's Dungeon than to get torn apart by some horrible monster.  

Besides, the only dangers in the world weren't in dungeons and it was high time the lad learned that.

## Tavern Encounter.  



As he sat, pulling on his ale. 

"And I will be the one to defeat he great Oddna, for on my way here, a wise village elder foretold me that I was the chosen one, destined to life a great evil from this land."

"But, but, but," said the young man in Mage Robes.

"Yes, only by my hand can the Wizard be slain, for I am," here he stood and finished with a flourish, "The Chosen One. Isn't that right Rattick" The Rogue did not look up from sharpening his knife to say, "Yes, that's right. Very true, I was there and heard the whole thing. "

[she returns and gives him the favor -- as the fight breaks out, he covers his tankard of ale and leaves.]

As he gets to his shop, she thows them both out on their ear. Chosen one not strong enough to get defeat an Innkeeper -- what was the world coming to these days

Then Rattick, the thief comes into the shop. Just when he is going to have his ale in peace. 

Sipping his ale, surveying his wares. Loving his goods and lamenting that there are so few buyers. Oh in the days gone buy

But now just some seedy adventurer selling rope. 

"I have," said Rattick, "a magic item of great power, that I could be persuaded to sell you. But understand, I feel I am making a mistake parting with it. It's just," his smile looked like a wound that had become infected with teeth, "I have a sister in Blovatia, and she's terribly, terribly ill."

"Yes. I understand how hard that can be," said Colbac, "Having your only Sister taken hostage."

"Hmmm," he lied, "and with the illness and the strain of confinement I need money for the journey and for medicines and, of course for ransom. So loathe as I am to part with it, I must."

"It is a sad tale of woe you tell, brave adventurer," said Colbac, laying it on as thick has he could, "I am just happy that, humble merchant that I am, I have the means to purchase such a magnificent item, paying, of course, more than it is worth, because your sad tale of woe has moved me -- turned my heart of stone into flesh once more."

"Yeah," said Rattick, not quite comfortable with Colbac's sudden enthusiasm.

"So, shall I shower you in gold now, or can I see the item first?"

"Oh, right. Or course. I keeps it wrapped away for safekeeping."

"I'm sure you do."

Rattick reached into his pants, underneath his tremendous codpiece and retrieved a wad of dirty rags.

"Yes, I can see the value straight away," said Colbac. "My nostrils fairly burn with it.""

"Look you," snapped Rattick, no longer comfortable with being out bullshitted, "I come here in the interest of serious commerce. And you mock me."

It was all that Colbac could do not to continue the farce. He strained to make, "No, no, please. I am serious. Show me the item."

Rattick set the ball of rags on the counter and began to unwrap it with great caution. As layer after layer was peeled, back, Rattick became even more careful, to the point where he removed the last covering with his sizeable and much-sharpened dagger.  

This was Colbac's first clue that the item was magic, and quite probably cursed. For reasons more primal than profit (survival being the only thing that Colbac put above profit) Colbac was an expert on magical items. Or more correctly, he was an expert on Wizards.

Wizards, you see ran to themes. 

Gauntlets of self-abuse

<!-- Insert wizard bits. -->

"Well, what do you think?" Rattick demanded. Colbac said nothing. He backed away from what appeared to be a fist-sized ruby slowly, never taking his eyes off it. With one hand behind his back he opened the cabinet that held his most prized possession -- his gloves. 

The popular name for them were Gauntlets of Negation, but the name was inaccurate. The Gauntlets did not negate magic, put rather, were perfectly magic neutral. Like a lightning rod conducts magic away from a house, these gloves conducted magical energy away from the use. They remained totally neutral to the effect of any spell, charm, hex or incantation. 

For all there rarity and power (some even thought them not to exist) they looked like a gigantic pair of wool mittens. The kind that looked like they should be connected by a long strand of yarn to prevent them being lost or separated by an absent-minded or irresponsible child. 

As Colbac donned his gloves, Rattick eyed them greedily. They were easily worth several hundred times more than the jewel on the counter. Colbac could see the thought floating in the thief's eyeballs -- *if only I could steal them*. Colbac thought little of it. After all that's the exact kind of thought that should drift through a good thief's mind. But there was something else about his glance. Something that bothered Colbac.

"So, where'd you get this magnificent jewel then?"

"Oh, I, uh, that is to say, I prized it from the deepest depths of the Lair of the Mad Wizard, Oddna."

"You?"

"Yes, a brilliant bit of thievery, if I do say so myself."

Colbac's hand stopped inches above the jewel. The whole scene could have easily taken on an air of the absurd, if not for the obvious fear that both men had for the object on the counter. "You, yourself then?"

"Yes, the pride and prince of thieves I am."

"Oh, I can well see that," Colbac said with smile that got no farther than his lips. "But here's the thing. If I was a thief..."

"Oh, don't sell yourself short Gov, you should hear the things that are said about you around town."

"... if I was a thief, instead of just a man with a deep and abiding love for negotiation, I wouldn't waste my time or energy frittering around in some dungeon. I'd find myself a nice seat at the dungeon's entrance."

"You would," said Rattick, playing along as if every one of Boltac's words were cast from the purest fascination. 

"Then'd I'd sit there until the last survivor of a party of adventurers came along. Battered, bedraggled, probably half-dead --"

"Or three quarters dead, if you really want to save yourself the effort," Rattick offered.

Botlac nodded acknowledgment and continued, "Then'd I slip a knife in his kidney and go through his pockets for loose change and valuable magical items."

"You've got quite an active imagination there, Gov," said Rattick, looking more afraid than guilty.

"I'm sorry, did you say active or accurate."

"I said, active."

"Well," said Boltac, with a shark's smile, "It makes no difference to me, you see. I'm just a man who acquires useful and resalable items for the benefit of my customers."

"Yes, I can see that," Rattick said with great relief.

"So, tell me, this unfortunate man who bequeathed you this jewel with his dying breath."

"Ohhh, I like that one better. And it sounds so good when you tell it."

"What he in his right mind."

"Yes, yes, right and generous he was."

"Was he, perchance, muttering anything. Acting strange in any way."

"Come to think of it," Rattick said with a sheepish grin, "He was going on about some beautiful girl. And how he had to save her."

"Ah, I thought as much," said Colbac. "I will give you a gold piece for your accursed gem."

"Accursed gem. Why Gov. you wound me. You really, really do. Do you think I would pass off accursed merchandize to a man of your standing."

"Only if you thought you could get away with it."

"I cannot take so little. That's highway robbery, that's what that is."

"Yes, and you would know. If a gold piece isn't enough"

"5 gold." 

Then just collect your stone and go. Rattick's hand moved forward, then he checked himself. He knew what it was and he was loathe to touch it. One brush of a man's skin and the mindstone would posesses his thoughts utterly. Inserting desires and thoughts into it as one might inject poison into a sausage. 

No man would want such a fate. Even Colbac was wary of it ( as he was wary of all magical items. ) How much happier he would be if there were no magical items left in the world.





It was a mindstone. Anyone could see that.

## The Geography and Economy of Robrecht


But however you choose pronounce it, Robrecht had been a delightful place to be a shopkeeper. It was a bit ambitious to call Robrecht a kingdom, or if it was, it was the smallest kingdom on the continent, perhaps in the world. 

If all of Robrecht were flat, it could be crossed by a strong-legged person in a two days. Some twenty to thirty miles square. Although, the true shape of the kingdom has changed with countless wars, invasions, treaties, marriages, births, deaths and pig raids throughout the years.

It's fertile central valley is surrounded on all sides by mountains of daunting height. So it is that Robrecht is supplied with water, fertile growing land and, by virtue of it's position in the world, a steady stream of trade. It is a curious fact that Robrecht has arisen not because of one mountain pass, but four. 

So it is, the crossroads of the continent of Combari and a fantastic place to be an innkeeper or a merchant. Or so it had been.

Because, unfortunately, the 

Colbac had paid a pretty penny to the King (more a of a duke really) to receive a royal warrant to open a store. While tinkers and shyster of all stripe and profession. Could trade from rolls spread out alongside the road, Colbac was the only merchant legally allowed to engage in commerce in the entire small, yet lovely kingdom. 

When he had first received his permission and opened his store, business had been wonderful. The high passes that connected Robrecht to the rest of the world meant that, for all but the worst winter months, a steady flow of traffic. It was something of geographic magic -- Robrecht itself was the middle of nowhere, but it was somehow on the way to everywhere. As a crossroads it flourished. 

There were the haulers and the drovers and the merchant caravans, but there was also the carriage trade. A few continental nobles followed by endless trains of retainers, baggage, equipage and hanger-ons. 

And when they would stop in Robrecht to visit the King/Duke, they would realize their lack of thread, or fabric or leatherworking tools, travelling cases, fine silverware, ladies daggers (for protection only) or any one of the many, many specialty items that Colbac took great pains to stock. 

For several years, Colbac's managed to put the past behind him and turn a tidy profit. He bought a fine house on the town's finest hill and established himself. 

Of course, there were so few merchants in those days, that no one quite knew how to treat Colbac. Surely he did not deserve the honors accorded to a knight, but he was something more than the serfs who worked the fertile plain. So there he was, invited to some events, banned from others, given a good seat at the temple, listened to by all men. 

Yet the rich, scheming dowagers did not see fit to try to marry of their heavily dowried and heavily fatted, cow-eyed, sampler sewing daughters to him. As a man with a broken heart this suited Colbac. 

And because no one knew exactly how to treat him, this suited Colbac right down to the ground. 

But the salad days never stay green for long. And the things that made Robrecht a perfect trading outpost and a well-defended kingdom from the outside -- it's mountains, it's abundance of mining wealth, the river and fertile plain. It's large glaciated lake -- it's tiny secluded valleys --  also made it attractive to another kind of 

Wizards. And Dragons and all of the awful creatures of the earth. 

What Colbac did not know, and perhaps could not know when he purchased his liscense to trade from the Duke/King was that the whole thing had been a raw deal from the word go. That the Duke/Kind had seen the writing on the wall from the very start. And now, in this relative calm, was looting the treasury, sucking up all he could and within a year would abandon his title and disappear to live in luxury in one of the warm, decadent cities of the far south. 

within the year, the 



If demography is destiny, then surely geography is something more. Something deeper and more primal. Geography is prophecy. Geography is a kind of gravity. The shape of place is a promise. Show me a natural, deep-water harbor and sooner or later, you will have a town. Oh, you can't say when this will happen. And you can't say that the inhabitants of the town will be tall and fair, and use sails to harness the power of the wind as the circle the watery globe as honest traders. Nor can you predict that they will we strong and swarthy, tattooed

# The Unlikely Kingdom of Robrecht 

On the banks of a lake and a fast moving river

Eelpout, and Steelhead are popular foods. 

The tower is known as the tower of mist, as it rises amidt the mist of the falls. (in olden times it was said to have frozen so solid that you could walk across)

The sigil of the Kingdom of Robrecht is the Korvado Forest Dragon -- a loathesome beast that attacks caravans like Air Pirhanas.


Boltac changes this to the Eelpout -- a fish that is known for it's great cunning (and looks like schools of silver pieces swimming though the water.)


(pronounced Raw-brecht)

Walled city -- grew up around a central keep built on a rock in the middle of the fast running, River Swift. Alternating square and round towers.

The Town outgrows it's original walls fairly quickly under Colbac's rule.

Right from the word go, Robrecht (pronounced Raw-brecht) was a raw deal.

Bordered on the north by Mercia, Castonax to the West, The ever hungry and rapacious Bloviatian Empire to the East and Chalcris to the South.  

A dutchy at best. A kingdom in the mountains in the center of the continent. Having a river, only navigable away from the keep (not big enough to be a castle in the time we set our story.)

A kingdom at a different altitude, a fiercer land where things not long for the world would retreat. A land known for great magical power, for Wizards and the heroes and adventurers who tried to stop them for the great good. Or, at least, loot their hordes for the good of their

But Robrecht stockpiles money it becomes a target.

"No, I can't say that I do," she said, making a face a the horrifying, repellent creatures that clawed and tore at each other.

"I call them Orcs."

"Organically Rendered Creatures of Servitude. Orcs. I'm quite proud of the name."

"Organically Rendered?" asked Asarah.

It's a Western in which the cowboys aren't worth a damn and the general store owner saves the day.


I first saw Boltac -- I was a bastard, like any other bastard. A masterless boy run riot through most of my life. My mother died in childbirth. My father killed in a war, perhaps drowned in a well. Or perhaps he ran off. 

"He's a bad man," the Chamberlain told, Boltac, "and no good will come of him." 

"No good will come of trifling with him," said Boltac, and made a motion as if he was to spit.

And in the center of the town was a river. In fact, it split the ancient hamlets of Ro and Brecht -- two entitites that had sworn beer oaths (in that there was quite a lot of alcohol involved) to fight until they had utterly wiped each other from the face of the earth.
