Chapter Intros

"In his youth, he swung a wooden sword and though himself safe as he boasted of conquests he had yet to make. But no man can pray to the goddess Adventure without consequence. When she called, he was fool enough to answer. His lust for plunder and glory left him penniless, friendless and lame. A hero no longer, he apprenticed with a shop keeper. He learned the ways of bargain and barter. Came to judge the worth of things and men. In time, he made what peace he could and forgot Adventure. He decided he was not Chosen. Not Destined to wear a jeweled crown upon a troubled brow. 

Adventure had slightly different ideas on the subject."





Boltac swept the front of the door clean. He limped along the cobblestones, swinging the broom with great vigor. The dust and filth of the street bounced down the hill in a small avalanche. It was good not to live at the bottom of the hill. 

When he was done he hitched his belt up underneath his round belly and surveyed the day. Business has been poor of late, something to do with politics -- politics always played hell with trade -- but Boltac was not worried. The sign over the store read M. Boltac, General Outfitter and Purveyor of Fine Items Infused with Mystical Properties and Magickal Energies. His barrel chest swelled with pride as he looked at his sign in the morning light. It had cost a pretty penny. Fourteen words was more that the sign painter had ever put one sign. 

Boltac thought is spoke of substance and bespoke class and sophistication. It certainly impressed the customers. "General Outfitter, Purveyor of Fine Items," he whispered. Times were always good for a General Outfitter you see, because a General Outfitter sold whatever people needed. Setting out to save a Princess, see the outfitter. Looking for something with which to destroy a loathsome Troll? See the Outfitter. As Boltac was fond of saying, "Great deeds are not accomplished without adequate provisions."

Commerce and Adventure



Between the time when the oceans drank Atlantis, and the rise of the sons of Aryas, there was an age undreamed of. And onto this, Conan, destined to wear the jeweled crown of Aquilonia upon a troubled brow. It is I, his chronicler, who alone can tell thee of his saga. Let me tell you of the days of high adventure!


He did not care any more... life and death... the same. Only that the crowd would be there to greet him with howls of lust and fury. He began to realize his sense of worth... he mattered. In time, his victories could not easily be counted... he was taken to the east, a great prize, where the war masters would teach him the deepest secrets. Language and writing were also made available, the poetry of Kitai, the philosophy of Sung; and he also came to know the pleasures of women, when he was bred to the finest stock. But, always, there remained the discipline of steel.
The children of Doom...Doom's children. They told my lord the way to the Mountain of Power. They told him to throw down his sword and return to the earth. Hah! Time enough for the earth in the grave.
All manner of pleasures and diversions were indulged. Wealth can be wonderful, but you know - success can test one's mettle as surely as the strongest adversary.
