# The Tavern, After



"That night, as we sat in the Inn, I told Boltac what I had heard."

"I don't like it," said Boltac. "Bad for business."

"Because a war is coming?"

"Eennh, I don't like it because it doesn't make sense. War is usually good for business, if you are a savvy businessman. Prices fluctuate wildly, smuggling becomes very profitable," but that only when it's a proper war. Two armies, each side, hungry for food and, ahem, entertainments. But this wizard, and his creatures, who can say what kind of war he makes."

"He's pretty angry. But in a calm way."

"Yes, that's the scariest thing of all. Apprentice, like as not, we'll be dead by morning. Or rich." He shrugged his shoulders in that fatalistic way with which he did everything that related to pain, loss and potential death and dismemberment. "Eh, I got no regrets. And you, you should be dead in the marketplace where I found you."

I rolled my eyes and sighed. 

"Oh, you want I should forget this debt?"

"No, I just think I will be forever paying it back," I said, reaching in for another helping of roast turnips.

"Ah!" he said, "Even as you try to eat all my profits. "   


Asarah, "You men with your fearsome imaginings. If I had a coin for every time I'd heard some man, deep in his cups, prophesy the end of the world in this common room -- fsheee -- I'd be a rich woman."

"But you do..." said Boltac.

Asarah cut him a look that would have melted through armor, had Boltac been foolish enough to think that armor would protect him from a beautiful woman. 

"At least, you should. Your patrons pay for their tankards of watered-down mead, do they not?" Boltac said, peering skeptically into his drink. 

"Aye, all of them but you."

"Well, there you go, all those coins, you're a rich woman. And one who his kind to her loyal customers." He said, raising his drink as if it was the finest example of the brewers art. 

"Well, then, the fact that I'm not should give you an idea of my overhead. To say nothing of the mental anguish comes from dealing with you lot. Would you like to try to weasel out of paying for another one there?"

Boltac smiled, "What can I say, I feel that I am a lucky man." 

Asarah scooped up the empty flagon and Boltac watched her go. "She's a beautiful woman, that one. But I wonder about her accounting."

"Rule Number One," I said. Boltac stopped me with an upraised hand.

"Don't RUIN it! Can't you see I'm having a moment here?" I shrugged and tucked into my supper. After a few bites, I realized the disturbing nature of what we had been discussing was unsettling my stomach.
