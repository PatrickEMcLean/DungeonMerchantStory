The Dungeon Crawl. It's an idea that has sunk it's teeth deep into our culture. From Oddessyus visiting the underworld, the frightened slave in Beowulf stealing a cup and awaking the Dragon, Dante journeying through hell, the brave companions journeying through the Mines of Moria --  Dungeons and Dragons, Zork, Rogue, Nethack, Adventure, Wizardry, Might and Magic, Ultima, Diablo, World of Warcraft... the essentials are always the same (and often predictably clich√©d) until you reach the extreme of the genre, Borderlands (I&II) You kill things, you gather loot. Perversely, the best loot in the game are guns which allow you to better kill things so you can get better loot which, in turn will allow you to better kill things.

So famously that Paolini and J.K. Rowling accused of ripping other books off. To which the only response is, of course they did. That's what authors do. Readers whine about integrity. A working writer will steal anything useful to get the job done.

Take away the graphics and where one game ends, another might begin. 

This was the lesson I learned working on the cRPG Wasteland 2. It's an apocolypse crawl.
