# Chapter 2 -- The Eelpout/Homely Inn

*Write from Asarah's point of view*

Beats of Homely Inn

Asarah and Boltac flirt. 

The heroes are jerks- grab her ass

Oddna chimes in. She is a beautiful woman

Asarah sighed and raked her hand through her long dark hair.

Instead of returning to the store, he trudged into the inn.

Smell of wood smoke, roasting meat and fine ale wrapped his senses in a comforting hug. On the left was a bar running the length of the building. To the left a common room with tables. Mostly empty now, given the hour of the day and the state of the town. But in the far corner, five people sat at one of the large round tables and clanked there tankards together. 

"Huzzah," they cried, "To us, the conquering heroes!"

Gah, thought Boltac, more adventurers. Mithras save us from this plague of adventurers. They had little enough money when the descended upon the town, but after they drank what little they came with they either made an ill-advised

Hero, thought Boltac, was just another word for a misfit who couldn't find a honest purpose in the world. He had known fighters in his time, some of them good. But all of the real ones had fought for loyalty or a steady paycheck. And these creatures, that drank and boasted in taverns, while they worked up the nerve -- who's bodies littered the countryside, dismembered in terrible and remarkable ways. Who only served to aggravate the Dread Wizard Oddna -- and really was he Dread? Maybe he just wanted to be left alone. To forget his past in where ever it was he came from -- that was a good a reason as any to come to the mountains of High Robrecht.

He bellied up to the well-worn bar. The

Goes to bar. Asks asarah is he can borrow an ale. 

"I hate to think what condition you'll give it back to me." She quipped. And the. She smiled. And just like that, gravity was a little lighter and he forgot the problems of the world for a little while. 

"Don't worry, it will be liquid."

And then, miracle of miracles, she laughed.  She she shook her head and as he long black hair rippled like waves through the water the crusty old merchant melted and for just a second you could see the little boy inside. 

Then she broke the spell by asking, "but seriously 'Tac" what's gotten into you?"

"Oh, he said, running a hand through his thinning hair in frustration, "this kid just came into my store asking to borrow a sword."

What? You mean like you'd borrow a cup of sugar. 

Yes, exactly. Except when you borrow a cup of sugar, you don't go off and use it to get yourself kills trying to save some damn fool... 
What?

Priestess of Dar. 

"Oh, virgin love," she said with a look in her eye that made Boltac realize, telling the truth about the less than virginal priestess was the wrong thing to do. 

"Hmmm," he said into his beer. 

"So, did you loan him the sword?"

"No," snapped Boltac, foam flying from his lips. "I hit him over the head with a club, dragged him across the street and left him unconscious on the bench out front."

Now her eyes flashed dark against the wave of her hair. "How *could* you?" 

"It was easy, actually, I just took my..." he trailed off, realizing that he just waded too deeply into the wrong answer. It did not pay to upset the only licensed provider of ale for 10 miles around, so he tried again. "Look, woman," realizing that he had gone even farther wrong as he said it, "What do you think monsters in that dungeon would have done to him. It's no pink tea you know. "




"Wouldn't you go?"


"No I wouldn't"



"And you *do* realize what it means?" she asked, laughing at him. 

Boltac didn't say anything. He looked away and his eyes unfocused as the memories tried to come flooding back. He took a long pull on the ale, gulping down nearly half of it.

Asarah -- but you see that's how she knows he loves her. He comes for her, risks everything against all odds for the love of his life. 

Boltac -- that's how she knows he's an idiot. 

Asarah -- You're a bitter, bitter man. 

Boltac -- What because I make good sense?

Asarah -- Because there's no romance in your life. No passion. No magic. 

Ugh, thought Boltac. Magic that's worse than romance


* She gives him a bit of handkerchief and lace to see if he can find more of it. He set's it as a favor on his helmet. (the ugliest helmet anyone had ever seen. That has a powerful magical ability, uniquely suited to Boltacs unusual (well unusual for an adventurer) skills.

-Isn't that right, Asarah?" but when he turned back, she was gone.

"She is a fine woman," said the man sitting two seats away at the bar. 

"Hunrn," grunted Boltac, for all the sentiment that gave away. When he turned he saw that the speaker was dressed in an expensive black fabric, with a sash of red as counter point to a fancy gentleman's sword with a brilliant red jewel in the hilt. He had the look of money about him. Boltac didn't remember seeing him when he came in. 

<!-- "Someone should do something about such adventurers," said Boltac, they are a plague on commerce and the commonwealth alike."

"Perhaps someone will," ventured the stranger, somewhat cryptically." 
 -->





Let Asarah and Boltac fight before she is kidnapped. 

Boltac leaves to summon the guard. 

He goes to collect Asarah, but she won't come. He curses her as a fool. She throws a knife at him. Sticks in the wall. 

Fine -- be independent. 

Why? Who's going to take care of me? You? Ha hahaha, Romantic Boltac?
