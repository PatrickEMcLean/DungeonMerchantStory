extra 

# Extra from Relan v. Shirley. 

Relan shook off the powerless feeling that came with the memories of being unable to rescue Sabriella. That wouldn't happen now, by the Gods. Now, things were different. Now he had a sword. Now he had boots and everything else  he could need. He had even killed an Orc. If clothes didn't make him a hero, didn't that have to? It counted for something, that was for sure. Something good.

Of course, anyone with half a brain could have seen this, but in his state, Relan didn't think of this. 




And then he was torn. Such carnage, such aggression, clearly the work of an *evil* wizard must be avenged. But Sabrellia still needed to be rescued. He stared down at the cobblestones as they passed beneath his magnificent boots and thought about it for a while. 

Then it came to him. He would do both, for both must be done. If he was to be a hero, truly be a hero, then he would have to do the hard things that other people wouldn't. But he didn't see how such a thing would be possible. 

But you broke your vows.

Sabrellia -- Stop, STOP! STOP IT! Hasn't there been enough killing? 


"It was a con. It was all a con. I was never kidnapped." 

"Never mind Sab, he's too thick to understand."

"No, he's not"

"But I loved you," Relan said, completely disarmed by this trickery. 

"I know you did"




* Have the kid find the love of his life, but the scoundrels are in on it. -- They let him know it was a con, and they are getting out. 

>But you broke your vows for me.
>I was never a real priestess.

That's what he would do. In his arrogance, he decided upon humility. He would not start off being the greatest hero ever. He would work up to it a step at a time. Helping people here and there, as the need arose. Of course, he would sally forth and destroy the Evil Wizard, that's what heroes did, but along the way he would make time to help the little people. The small folk of which he was quickly forgetting that he was one. 



  And, for the first time in his life, he walked like someone else. He had selected what he thought was the best of everything from Boltac's store. Spare no expense, for their was none!

When Boltac had left the store, Relan 

>runs into the girl and one of her accomplices, carrying two bodies in a wheelbarrow. They try to rob him. He hits the girl, then runs away. Outdistancing pursuit. 

>Confronts the con. But you told me she was trapped in a tower! 




One of the friends is wounded. 
Oh Shit! Cried one of the kidnappers!

he backhands her and runs away. Ashamed and embarrassed. 


----





"No, you are most assuredly that. The stench of the lower classes is upon you, especially your impudence."

"Impudence!" Asarah snapped, knowing it was a dangerous and stupid thing to do, but so angry at this arrogant man that she couldn't bring herself to care. 

"No I am glad you refused because now you have absolved my guilt."

"Guilt? What are you talking about? You should already feel guilty, you kidnapped me!"

"Oh, dear, no. I rescued you from a city under siege. Very sensitive and noble of me."

"You burned down my Inn!"

"Yes, well, there was that. Fit of temper. Besides, I burned up two of my sandwiches. Two sandwiches that I --"

"Didn't even pay for!"

"ENOUGH!" Dimsbury thundered, so loud that bits of rock and dust tumbled down from the vaulted ceiling of the chamber. "You were a pleasant diversion, but no more. "



* Rattick before the Wizard -- reveal that they are friends. he sets up Boltac. 
* Boltac and Relan hide from the Orc's -- have a bit of misadventure. 
* * where's Rattick -- who cares, we're pressing on. Which way? Down

>Wizard -- don't you see, your companion has betrayed you. 
>Boltac -- don't you see, that's the nice thing about making deals rather than fighting. He can't really betray me. I wanted to meet you and now I have. 
>Wizard -- And now you will die. 
>Boltac -- That might not be in your best advantage. 





# And a bunch of confused wolves

And a bunch of confused wolves, wondered why they had been spending so much time underground. So they followed smell of fresh air out of the depths, snarled at each other, divided up into reasonably-sized packs once again and headed out to cause no end of trouble and woe for the deer of the thick, heavily-misted forests of Robrecht. The deer had grown fat and slow and plentiful in the wolves hiatus, but now they were in for a shock. The slow would be eaten. The fast would grow faster and so, everything would return to the way it should be.



# Asarah gives Boltac confidence to be king

>I can't be a king, I'm not noble. 

>We'll, if you can't be a king, then we are doomed, simply doomed to have men like him rule over us -- YOu are cheap, I will give you that Mr. Boltac. 


"You might not be able to be a King Mr. Boltac, but I could definitely be a Queen."

"But," said Boltac, "It's so much work,"

"Pfahh "

"But I wouldn't want have servants or slaves."

"Who said you have to have servant? And servants and slaves are two very different things."

"I know, dear," said Boltac.

"Aw, you called me dear."

"You don't like it?"

"No, I do. I really do." There was another kiss and then she continued. "But you don't need, servants. You don't have to force anyone to do anything. But can you just hire people to help you."

"Hire, but servants are bound to the families…"

"You know while you are daydreaming, dear, you don't have to stick to the rules of reality. And are all servants bound to "

"Wait, wait, did you say hire," Boltac said, lapsing out of the sweet trance of cuteness for the first time since they had escaped.

He leaned out of the carriage window and shouted to Relan, "Turn this thing around, we're going the wrong way!"

"But Robrecht is south!" said Relan, "If there's anything left of it."

"Yeah, I know, but to save the city we gotta go North before we go South."

"I don't understand?"

"I know. That's not your job. It's my job. And speaking of which, do you want a job? I am hiring?"

"Wait, what? But I'm an adventurer."

"And can you possibly imagine anyone else who could have taken you on a bigger adventure?"

"No," said Relan, "But you had the adventure."

"Whattya mean, you were there? You were there the whole time!"

"But you got the girl at the end. That's the way an adventure works. You get the girl at the end and live happily ever after."

"I have two things to say to that. Eh, but never mind. We don't have time. Just trust me, the adventure ain't over yet."

"But we're out of danger," said Relan.

"Trust me, what I have in mind, kid. Probably get us all killed."

"Oh," said Relan, with a smile, "then I'm in!" And he urged the horse into a gallop. 

"Okay," Boltac shouted over the rushing of the air and the thudding of the horse's hooves. "You're hired. Now don't disturb me until we get there. I've got important business back here."

"Get where?" Relan shouted. 

"Oh, you'll know when we get there. I promise." And Boltac pulled his head back in the carriage.


# Mignola Scene

> Mignola-esque shuffling off into the darkness scene so Samga can come back later. And the Orc's



In the lighter darkness Samga spoke with the elder one in the broken, hissing tongue of Orc's. (between them they try to make the language who)


For in the darker darkness he could not speak for the weight of the blackness pressing in on him from all sides. And in the darkest darkness, he feared that the blackness would fill his lungs and he would drown in night. 



And now we die. 

No, many of the husks will falter, but we will go on?

How can you be sure, I feel the beat of my heart slowing as we speak, the magic is 

The magic of man is draining out of you, but the deeper magic. The magic of life… can you feel that starting?

No. 

You have spent too much time around the human's Samga. Retreat with me into the darkness a while and I will tell you what I have learned from listening deep inside my self. 

Samga followed the older one into the darkest darkness under the ground. 

We have made choices for ourselves, we have our own spirit young one, and the thing of the spirit can never truly die.
