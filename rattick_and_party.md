Rattick really should have put that Troll on the payroll. There were only two obstacles to that line of thinking. 1. Rattick never parted with a coin he didn't have to. 2. Talking to Trolls is exceedingly hazardous to your health. And Rattick, as he was fond of saying, didn't stick his neck out for nobody. 

Academically he could understand how sad it was that three brave, if naive, underprepared and very stupid adventurers had just been turned into a fine red paste by the angry troll that lurked in the back of the first level.

After the fight died down, and all the parties had been thrown out in the street. Rattick made his move. He sidled up to the party and said, "You know, I wasn't going to join you, but after seeing the ferocity and prowess"

He is seized, they drag him before Oddna. he tries to negotiate for the woman -- she gets upset because he's buying her (like a slave) he confesses his love. 

Oddna mocks the woman -- she's the sandwich wench. How sad that you are in love with the Sandwich wench. 

She looked hurt, but to Boltac's eyes, he had never seen her look so beautiful before. I have made you an offer, do you decline

Oddna throws it open to the room -- to his boys. They all laugh at Boltac. For coming here. For thinking he would get away with this with his life. You've been making a living off all of my fallen children. In essence, paying people to come kill them for their posessions and their teeth -- in once instance for their body parts. Do you know in the far southern reaches of _______________ Orc Pizzle is believed to be an aphrodesiac. 

Really, Orc Pizzle. 

Yes, they dry it, grind it up into a powder and make it into a tonic.

How do they know it's real Orc pizzle? 

I don't know. Perhaps it has an unmistakable flavor. I would think it would almost have to.
