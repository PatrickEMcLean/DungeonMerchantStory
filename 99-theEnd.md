But you are just a... a... filthy merchant.

"Ah-HAAA!" said Boltac, holding up a finger, "I am a merchant. But I'm merchant with an army."

"Yes, but that hardly elevates your status. Do fealty to the Gods and respect there representatives on Earth."

"Eeeh, Gods? I've only got one God. Simpler that way. Less overhead, easier record-keeping. And I'm not convinced that you and God are on speaking terms. Besides, what does that make you?"

"Excuse me?" said Torvalds, looking confused. 

"So I gotcha army. You are minus an army. Having, if we're talking about accounting here. Zero armies. I'm a merchant with a Army. We don't know what that makes me. But you are a nobleman with no army, and I know what that makes you."

"Oh really," said Torvalds, dripping with contempt. What does that make me?

"Outnumbered."

There was an uncomfortable silence.  

"Yu-heah," Boltac said, "Now it's starting to sink in. Arithmetic can be terrifying, can't it?"

For perhaps the first time in his life, Torvalds looked afraid. He glanced to the left and the right. His bodyguards had disappeared. He spun around. There on the side of a brightly colored tent, one of his men was drinking with a group of the Bereft Companions. Their laughter carried through the afternoon air. His man, still in the livery of the Noble Empire of Mercia, felt his recent master's gaze upon him. He turned, and not without some sadness, raised his flagon to his old boss. 

"How could he?"

"They made him a deal, your eminence," said Boltac, "Join them or, well, join *them*," he pointed over Torvald's other shoulder. Torvald turned and saw his other bodyguard's corpse being thrown on a pile of corpses on the other side of the field. 

"How dare you, I am here under a flag of truce."

"Weakness. That particular flag," said Boltac, pointing at the white standard flapping in the wind. "Is a flag of weakness. And I will now give you a very important lesson. A lesson you should have learned long, long ago. When you were his age." Boltac jerked a thumb in my direction and said, "Tell the man rule number one."

I wracked my brain. There had been so many rule number one's throughout our time together. Once I had asked Boltac how so many rules could be number one at once. He turned very serious and said, "Some rules are more number one than others. Knowing which rule is number one at any time is the trick of it." So what was the most number one rule right now? 

I smiled and said, "Rule Number One, don't negotiate from weakness."

Boltac waited for the penny to drop. 

"Negotiate," said Torvalds, "But what do you want?"

"Ah, I thought you'd never ask." Boltac snapped his fingers and a scribe came forward with a piece of paper. Torvalds what was written on it and his eyes grew wide?

"That's right bubbie, I want all of it."

"I can't. I, this is unheard of"

"Of course it is. "






" And you, you are a nobleman with out an army.""
