# Boltac Scene Breaks 

Boltac in the Shop 

    Kid comes to borrow a sword -- hint at adventurer past -- he gives the kid a sword. 

    Rattick sells a jewel ( a mind stone )

    Wealthy noblewoman's maid comes in -- turns out she's buying for her nephew. Something seems strange -- need this quickly. Please, none of you chatter, my good man, just do it. 

        He checks her coins to see if they are creepers. 

            Oddna is the wizard who makes the monsters and magical items.


Boltac goes to get Dinner -- flirts with ______ She goes away and he talks a myserious stranger (Wearing sunglasses?) who turns out to be Oddna. They talk about how delicious the sandwiches are. 

Some adventurers break up the tavern (in a fight over who is really the chosen one) Boltac gets the Innkeeper outside -- they call for the guard, but no guards come. 

He consoles her -- let them fight it out -- then we will petition the Duke in the morning. stranger says, "What a shame it is. You have such a nice place here." And then he leaves -- on his way to the door a man tries to strike him but suddenly his back seizes up. 

She comes in the morning and they have left. 

She cries on his shoulder. (She's stronger than I am, thought Boltac, I cannot unburden my sorrows. The rules of youth stayed with him.)

The next day the Duke is gone -- this is not good. Then the town is sacked. She is taken -- Boltac runs to his store, flips the closed sign and the looters cannot get in. 

Change perspective to Rattick guiding the party on the road

   Hiring Rattick as a guide -- uh, we are, uh, financially challenged

    Rattick and his adventurer's on the road, he hides them as the raiding party goes past -- That was a large one -- I don't know where they are headed

    The party that destroyed the inn sets out to defeat the Wizard -- Rattick is not with them. 

Boltac sits in his store, watching people go past all day. Buying things that they need to leave. 

Orc's riding in on wolves. He puts up Boltac's bar of warding -- puts a magical seal across the door. But through the window, he sees he Orc's converge on the Inn -- Asarah!

Grabs a sword from the sword stand (a cheap thing, heavy and ill-balanced) but a young voice inside him, said, "You'll not need more to dispatch a few Orc's"

He opens the door -- slays one Orc, slays the next -- then he feels something tear in his chest -- it is the old wound -- and he drops the sword. An Orc is about to smash his head in with a club -- when his captain barks -- Let's go. Over his shoulder he carries Asarah

She cries out, "Help! The mace comes down on Boltac's head -- "

Darkness. He is awakened by the rain. He has wolf prints on his chest. He crawls across the way to his store. Uses his good arm to pull the cork out of a healing potion -- takes a long pull and surveys the wreckage of his store. 

Bunch of shit has been stolen -- all the stuff in the display case -- the costume jewelry of weapons and armor. Someone tried to make off with the plate armor, but it was too heavy and they abandoned the task halfway through -- there are long drag marks in the floor. 

Looks at the coin still trapped in the floorboards.  

He bars the door -- even the rain is cannot pass the broken windows. 


Boltac can't stand it any longer. He knows that 

He tells himself that it was the mutton sandwiches that made life worth living, but deep down, he knows it's not true, and that's what scares him most of all. 

Big fight, the shop is broken open. 

He goes home and goes to bed. Realizes why he hates the adventurers. Because he tried and failed. 

The next morning he and the woman petition the Duke, but he's left town. (cause he knew the invasion was coming) Like the secret passage is still open. 

Orc's on Wolves roll into town and sack everything. Boltac's store defends itself -- Boltac talks to one of the orcs Maybe the Orc grabs the mace of encumbrance. Leaving Boltac free to question him. 

He goes across to the Inn to see if she's okay -- but she's gone. Kidnapped. 

The men burned an O glyph for Oddna in the floor. 

## That night he doesn't sleep at all. 

    Realizes how lonely he is. Where are the heroes? The real heroes. Why don't they come. Perhaps the Duke has gone for help -- but in his heart he knew that wasn't the case -- the Duke with his fleshy children had abandoned his duchy -- and why not? Robrecht had always been a raw deal for a ruler. Native inhabitants as sly and cunning as any in the world when it came to getting out taxes, a land infested with Wizards and the kind of beasts that would cause an army to be raised if they were even mentioned in the lowlands, Trolls and Wendigo and LizardMen and now even a rumor of Dragon's to the east!

    Not that the monsters matter much to the Duke himself. He was no hunter nor outdoorsman. But on all sides of Robrecht were kingdoms wanting to claim her difficult tax revenue, mineral wealth and strategic position as a crossroads for themselves.

    No it was a dubious honor to be lord and master of Robrecht, and Colbac couldn't see that any nobleman he had ever known had the skill for it. It did not require high-mindedness or nobility or even the trappings of heroism. It required a cunning mind and a calculating hand to steer the ship of Robrecht. The Duke simply hadn't been trained for it. 

    No, more like he had emptied what were left of his coffers and pulled up stakes and headed South to one of the Kingdoms of the sun. Where he would buy an estate and soak the sun and the wine until he met his end like all men one day must. 

    But what of the people of Robrecht. What of him, and his dreams of selling the store, becoming unshackled from it at last. Was there no one to set the ship of state aright. Were all the people of this troubled region doomed to crushed under a wave of feckless adventurers on the one hand and a plague of powerful and malicious wizards on the other? 



## Later that morning a customer comes by 

    -- peers in the window. looks like the store is the same, it's just closed. But it was nearly lunchtime. No one had ever known Colbac to take a day off. But every thing looked as it should be. 
    But what he couldn't see was -- coin pried from the floor. A few of the more expensive articles 

    coin pried from the floor. 

## He "hires" Rattick

    At the entrance to the Dungeon, he catches Rattick coming out with a sack of valuables and the Dragon helmet from the night before (he jokes to himself, I am the chosen one.)

    Boltac slips the helmet down across Ratticks face, bashes the helmet with the pommel of his dirk and backs him up against a tree with the point of the knife. 

    "What could I do, they were chosen. They chose themselves."

    He gets the story from Rattick. Explains that the Wizard has gotten so sick of adventurer's disturbing his work, that he posted a troll at the highest level of the dungeon to keep them away. The troll on the inside -- I guide them

    "Ah, you're right," said Boltac, probably did the world a service. "You want half a sandwich."

    Tries to hire Rattick -- rattick says no way -- I tell you what, why don't you just guide me to this troll. If I succeed, maybe you'll have the faith to join me all the way. If not, well, you'll get everything I have. 

    "My liege, I am in your service."

    "Good man."

    Boltac could trust a man who was in it for himself. You knew what he was going to do. It was the holy men and the altruists, the heroic-minded and the magic mazed you had to watch out for -- they could do anything at any time for any reason. 

## Finds girl in Oddna's Court
    
    You shouldn't have come to rescue me. 

## Rattick Betrays him

    Taken before Oddna. 

## He tries to buy the Girl

    So he goes into the dungeon. The woman tries to get him to leave -- You've come to fight for my Honor. I thought you were smarter than that!"

    "No, I'm not here to fight for your honor. I'm here to buy you."

    "BUY ME! What do you think I am, some kind of whore!"

    "Keep your voice down," said Colbac, but by then it was too late. 

    Monsters sprung up from all corners of the room. The menagerie scuffled and howled as their master rose from his couch and waved light into the room with a wizarding gesture. 

    "What have we here? Why it is my fellow mutton lover. Tell me, what brings you to the depths of my lair."

    Colbac could see no percentage in lying. He jerked a thumb at [THE INNKEEPER] and said, "Her."

    "Oh really, is it true love?" asked Oddna with great relish. When they both blushed, he laughed. "Oh my, it _is_ true love. And I thought it was rarer than unicorns. But wait, no it can't be true love, because you told me you had no interest in her. Or don't you remember. I admit, I was in disguise, but I would think a sophisticated man of commerce, such as yourself, would remember."

    "I said she wasn't my _____, that doesn't give you liscense to steal her."

    "I don't care for being stolen, Roderick," said [the INNKEEPER]

    "Roderick?" asked Colbac with a snicker, "Well no wonder you've turned evil in your dotage. Was it all those children who taunted you in school that turned your heart to evil?"

    Oddna looked at him for a long time. Long enough for every creature in the room, except the strange, powerful wizard to grow uneasy. Mostly it was his smile. It seemed to grow and grow, stretch endlessly under those dead eyes. 

    "Yes, you are right. I have stolen her, fair and square, and she is mine. And you have come to fight for her. Take you pick of the creatures you see here before you. You may fight any one of them for her hand. Then, if you win, you may fight the rest of them. And then, if you defeat all of them, you may do battle with me."

    "No," began Colbac.

    "No? What do you mean no? You have come here as an adventurer -- as the Hero -- to rescue the damsel in distress. You must fight? You must. That's how these things work."

    "I'm not here for a fight. You stole her, fine, she is your property, but I thought perhaps we could make a a deal."

    "BUY ME!" protested Sarah, "is that your idea of chivalry. Buying the woman you love back from..."

    "I never said anything about Love or Chivalry," Colbac snapped in that way that you can only get angry about someone you really, really care about. "You know how many men have tried to defeat the great Oddna? You know how many have succeeded?"

    "None," said Oddna with a great swelling of pride. "I'm entirely too powerful to be defeated by any but the chosen one, if he even exists. And if he does exist, I'm sure he's not a short, grubby, lame merchant from the backwater town of Robrecht."

    "Yes, yes, mighty Oddna -- you are a rich, wise and powerful man. Quick to perceive your own advantage and capitalize on it. So I offer you a lucrative trade."

    Oddna's red eyes narrowed, "A trade you say, tell me more..."

    Colbac reached into his bag of holding and withdrew a large coin purse that he showed to be overflowing with gold. "I offer 100 gold pieces for the girl."

    "Girl?" Oddna snorted, "A handsome woman, certainly, but not a girl."

    "The offer stands, a 100," he hefted the purse and reconsidered, "A hundred and two gold pieces, for [THE INNKEEPER]"

    "But I have such a love of her mutton sandwiches. Crisp and fatty and delicious."

    "I cannot compel one so powerful as you to do anything, but my offer presents you with a clear choice -- mutton sandwiches, or the gold."

    "Oh that word. I cannot abide that word. Or. So harsh on the pallet, so cruel to the ear. I do not accept ors."

    Colbac nodded his head deeply in recognition. I understand Great Wizard. I understand. But all life is trade-offs. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Surely you understand this. The money or the girl."

    "No, I'll take the and."

    "And," asked Colbac.

    "And," asked [THE INNKEEPER]

    "Unh?" grunted the Orcs

## All is lost

    Boltac tells him not to open the bag with the gold. There are forces in there that are too powerful for you. 

    What? Let me tell you how powerful I am -- boast and brags. Source of all magic. 

    You see this smudge the Kolbolds are cleaning here. Yes that a retainer of mine who sought to channel that power. Burned him to a crisp, instantly." He kicked the giant oaken bucket and slopped water out on the poor, wretched creature scrubbing the floor. "Put your back into it, or I'll make your cousin's clean up a black spot that it you!"

    I have to be very careful -- what I do here, what I put through the portal has tremendous consequences for magic everywhere and at all times. If this flame goes out -- the portal between our world and the next -- the conduit through which the magical energy flows would be shut off. Magic itself might disappear!

    "Ah,"" said Colbac, "The antikathetiton,"

    "You know this arcane device?"

    "Yes, first attempted by Myglorg the One-eye, the great Orcist wizard of the Methorian age. I thought it was a myth."

    "So did I. But you can see my genius has brought it back to life. But how do you know of such things?"

    Explains about identifying magical items. Reading books in the Duke's library. Asking questions. 

    So, you can see that I am more powerful than any wizard that has ever been. 

    "Well, you've certainly got the ego for it," said Colbac with a smile. 

    "Alright, tear him from my misery -- "

    Colbac warns him again. And then he whistles. 

    Oddna, sends up a warding spell, very quickly then asks, "Was that all? I mean really, a whistle. Not even a spell of Darting Death. A teleportation? A magic missle. Nothing? Just a whistle?"

    "Just a whistle."

    "Ahk!" cried one of the Orcs. He beat

    Coins devour his minions. Chaos ensues. 

    "YOU!" thundered Oddna. He raised his hands and pointed his fingers, no doubt to cast some terrible spell. But quickly the finger spread in supplication. 

    Colbac hefting the bucket. 

## Colbac hires two legions of soliders. He makes Rattick his minister. 

    "No Rattick, I don't want to trust you. I want you to try everything you possibly can. If I'm safe against my friends, I will be safe against my enemies."

    "My Lord, I am at your service."

    "And remove the sarcasm from your voice Rattick. I actually am a Lord now." He unfolded four sheets of paper. 

    He had gotten all the kingdoms to recognize him as king in return for a treaty that allied Robrecht 

    "You will go to war with everyone?"

    "No. We will be neutral."

    "Neutral," asked Rattick, "you mean as a ruse?"

    "No, I mean we will be neutral."


    And you are Lord Colbac?

    "No Rattick, I have adopted a new name consitutient with my new station in life. I am the first Lord Robrecht. Now kneel before me and accept your knighthood." 

    "Knighthood?"

    "Yes Rattick. What's the matter? You think King's shouldn't have a sense of humor."

    "This is going to be a very different sort of kingdom, my liege," Rattick said without even a hint of sarcasm."

    "Yes, Rattick, it is. There's no magic anymore, Rattick. Who knows where the progress will stop."

Rattick is stopped at the border. He is dragged before the King -- turns out to be Colbac

The Merchant Heroic. The Bourgeois Heroic. The Burgher Heroic.

Coins as pets and living things. Tried to train them to respond to a whistle, but couldn't get any useful responses. At least not any responses that people would pay money to watch

Boltac is a merchant -  A long time ago he was an adventurer and he failed. Bitterly and all his companions died. While he was out adventuring his family was killed by raiders. (he bears the guilt -- maybe he could have saved them.) Still doesn't want to be a farmer so he becomes a merchant. 

Goes seeking his dead, but he is washed down the river and winds up at the docks of Robrecht. The duke himself fishes him out -- he saves the Duke's life. Taking a wound to the leg in the process. Duke offers to make him Captain of the Guard -- Boltac refuses -- but what can I give you? He wants to be a shopkeeper. 

He is given a license to open a shop and he is the official procurer for the Duke. 

Years pass. A shadow falls across the land. Each year seems to bring more wizards and more monsters. The flourishing land of Robrecht starts to fade because trade falls off. Now, the only people who come to Robrecht are adventurer's. All the good ones fail to root out the Wizard Oddna. They don't come back. 

Meanwhile, the bunch of also ran's choke up the dying town, and wear on the Innkeeper a lovely Red-Headed lass named __________. She's in love with Boltac, and has been for years, but Boltac doesn't think himself worthy of happiness after all. -- He's a failure (he doesn't give himself any credit for being a successful merchant.)

Some adventurers break up the tavern (in a fight over who is really the chosen one) Boltac gets the Innkeeper outside -- they call for the guard, but no guards come. He consoles her -- let them fight it out, then we will petition the Duke in the morning. 

She cries on his shoulder. (She's stronger than I am, thought Boltac, I cannot unburden my sorrows. The rules of youth stayed with him.)

The next day the Duke is gone -- this is not good. Then the town is sacked. She is taken -- Boltac runs to his store, flips the closed sign and the looters cannot get in. 

The party that destroyed the inn sets out to defeat the Wizard -- Rattick is not with them. Boltac sits in his store, watching people go past all day. Buying things that they need to leave. 

Orc's riding in on wolves. 

Boltac can't stand it any longer. He knows that 

He tells himself that it was the mutton sandwiches that made life worth living, but deep down, he knows it's not true, and that's what scares him most of all. 

So Boltac set's out. On foot, quietly, with a bag over his shoulder and his cane at his side. 

He walks off the road, moving as quietly as he can through the brush. After a day of walking, he finds a hot spring. Has the last mutton sandwich, rolls himself in a blanket and goes to sleep under the stars. He almost feels good, but then he remembers that night so long ago. 

FLASHBACK -- the party under the stars around a fire grim Boltac, laughing, drinking, boasting. Vowing to defeat the PARLAC

(Later it turns out that the PARLAC was Oddna's first creation -- a failure, but one that had a life of it's own.) Oddna killed all his friends -- then put a blight upon the land -- killing Boltac's parents. 

Sleep -- nightmares


Jump to Rattick shadowing the party. He knows they don't stand a chance, hopes to look them. But by the time he gets ther


A figure shilohetted against the darkness of the dungeon. Rattick is terrified for a moment and then realizes it's the merchant. 

Jokes with him, asks him where he's going. 

<!-- "Oddna," said Boltac, "I'm going to kill him." -->

I'm going to rescue my girl. 

"Ho ho ho, that's very noble I'm sure but to do that you'd have to first get past the troll, the one I just saw bolt down and entire party."

"I want to hire you."

"What, to go in there? But I told you, the troll."

"A gold piece for a day, for however long the adventure lasts."

"But I'm a thief. Like a thief, thief -- a good one. I can't be trusted. Even if you could get past the troll."

"If I can get pass the Troll, will you be my retainer?"

'Yes'

Defeats troll with mace of encumbrance.

Down they go. 



At the middle he has lost all his gear, all his gold, has been defeated by Oddna and thrown into the land of misfit toys. 


---

Boltac has an encounter with the Evil Wizard in the Tavern -- as they both enjoy a mutton sandwich. (she has cast a spell on me.)

She certainly seems to like you 

--No, no, I am just a good neighbor. 

Suit yourself.

But he left without making any kind of advance to the innkeeper. Boltac thought it strange. 

---


Finally, upset with constant interruptions to his work, the Wizard Oddna razes the town of Robrecht. And he steals the Innkeeper.

Uses creeping coins. 

Hires the Orcs

---

Creeping coins -- and he took every coin in the shop. Even the one he had to pry out from between the floorboards (he wants the coin, but doesn't want to pay to have his floor repaired -- which would cost more coins.)

In the final confrontation, The Great Werdna regains the "loyalty" of all his followers and has them attack Boltac and his (they have to be) four companions. Boltac activates the coins -- they never responded to training -- they only became violent at the sound of the little silver whistle.  

The coins attack everyone and they all die. Money under the skin. Sated by blood, they went to sleep. 

Then Wernda powerless, he rescues the girl -- 


She asks him to steal the artifact. It has great power -- you could be a great sorcerer -- Ah you were after the power. 

Werdna grabs for the fabulous mace protruding from his spilled bags of artifacts -- wham, Mace of encumbrance - enchanted by the jokester mage -- 

Smashes the artifact -- all the magic in the world is gone. All the creatures drop dead -- woman turns out to be a succubus and falls over dead

He takes a traveling companion of his to wife -- the age of sorcery is over. Merchants have power. 

Left the creeping coins in a pile.




End of the story -- destroy all magic? That sounds like wonderful idea. 

What about the Wizards and the wonderful magical creatures and the elemental forces that hold the world together. It would all disappear.
