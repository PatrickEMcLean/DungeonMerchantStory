Uses creeping coins. 

Hires the Orcs

---

Creeping coins -- and he took every coin in the shop. Even the one he had to pry out from between the floorboards (he wants the coin, but doesn't want to pay to have his floor repaired -- which would cost more coins.)

In the final confrontation, The Great Werdna regains the "loyalty" of all his followers and has them attack Boltac and his (they have to be) four companions. Boltac activates the coins -- they never responded to training -- they only became violent at the sound of the little silver whistle.  

The coins attack everyone and they all die. Money under the skin. Sated by blood, they went to sleep. 

Then Wernda powerless, he rescues the girl -- 


She asks him to steal the artifact. It has great power -- you could be a great sorcerer -- Ah you were after the power. 

Werdna grabs for the fabulous mace protruding from his spilled bags of artifacts -- wham, Mace of encumbrance - enchanted by the jokester mage -- 

Smashes the artifact -- all the magic in the world is gone. All the creatures drop dead -- woman turns out to be a succubus and falls over dead

He takes a travelling companion of his to wife -- the age of sorcery is over. Merchants have power. 

Left the creeping coins in a pile.




End of the story -- destroy all magic? That sounds like wonderful idea. 

What about the Wizards and the wonderful magical creatures and the elemental forces that hold the world together. It would all disappear.
