The Merchant Adventurer
By Patrick E. McLean

# Chapter One: Good Money Drives Out Bad

Once upon a time there was a town called Robrecht. At first it was little more than a remote crossroads in the high mountains. But when traveller met traveller and one of them lifted his cloak and said, "Psst, buddy, wanna buy an hourglass," a trading post was born. 

As the years went by, the places at the far ends of the crossroads grew into mighty kingdoms and powerful empires. Which made Robrecht (now that it had grown big enough to have it's own name) something of a paradox; a town in the middle of nowhere, but on the way to everywhere. 

It was the kind of place that people would pass through and say, "Y'know, if I wanted to disappear, just leave all that nonsense behind me, this would be the place." So it slowly filled with wanders and wastrels and ne'er do wells and most importantly, for our story wizards.

Wizards, it is generally acknowledged, are a strange, solitary breed. Which is good because they meddle with powers beyond their ken. [^ken] They often die horrible, pyrotechnic deaths as they stumble around in the darkness of human ignorance searching for what they call knowledge but finding what normal, workaday people like you and I would call mistakes. 

So it was that the peaks and high valleys surrounding Robrecht became fairly littered with abandoned mines turned into dungeons, towers built by creatures constructed or enslaved, mysterious and powerful shrines, and a cautionary assortment of blast craters. In most of these places lurked death. But in a few them there was also treasure. So, in addition to being a natural hub of trade and commercial activity, Robrecht became a stepping off point for Adventurers of all shapes, sizes and abilities. 

In the very center of Robrecht was the market square. And on the southeast corner of the very center of Robrecht there was a sign that read "Boltac's Trading Post." Beneath the sign there was a store. And at the very heart of the store, sitting on a high stool behind a wide oak counter was a short man with shaved head and large belly named Boltac. 

While many buyers and sellers came to Robrecht on market day, Boltac's was the only permenent store in town. What kind of a store did he have? What kind of a store didn't he have? Boltac bought and sold everything an adventurer might need for what ever ill-advised expedition he or she might be embarking on. For those of you who have spent your daydreams raiding deep dungeons, high towers and far castles, you know what this includes. For everyone else there is the next paragraph. 

Boltac bought and sold all manner of weapons, armor, scrolls, potions, projectiles, charms, jewelry, comestibles, any tools -- anything any everything an adventurer might need for plumbing the depths of a dungeon and removing it's contents from the rightful owners. As a keen salesman, he preyed upon the fear and greed of his customers. But mostly the fear. Setting off into the unknown, by definition is a fearful business.

"Do I really need and ointment to protect myself from Xagreeptian Spider Bites. Xagreep is a thousand miles to the south?" a customer might reasonably ask.

"Better to have it and not need it. Than need it and not have it," Boltac would reply. 'My only concern is your safety and well being." Boltac was also inordinately fond of saying, "And don't forget your torches!" 

Mixed in among the ointments and unguents, flails and morningstars, bucklers and plate mail were some items which were *genuinely* magical. Given the dangers of Wizardry, genuinely magical items were quite rare, but they did exist. The problem was, most of them were cursed. 

For example, Magrief's infamous Gauntlets of Self-Abuse. To the untrained eye, they appeared to be nothing more than an exceptionally high quality pair of metal gloves. But once donned, they forced the wearer to constantly and ceaselessly do unsavory things to themselves. [^things] In his earlier days Boltac had been sold a pair of these gloves by traveller. With the native cunning of all shopkeepers, he had seen fit to identify them before putting them on. 

Of all the great legendary Wizards of Robrecht's storied past, Boltac held a special grudge against Magrief. Magrief had done something which no other wizard had dared to do. Not only had he did he manage to create magical items, but he created an entire race of magical creatures. 

Very few people knew of the existence of these creeping coins, there being fewer banks in those days. But they were terrible and terribly dangerous. In fact, they had cost Boltac his one and only apprentice. 

Boltac's apprentice was named was Avarcious, but he's not going to live very long in this story, so there's not really reason for you to remember his name. He had sandy blonde hair, bright blue eyes and smile that seemed to make everyone's spirits and skirts lift. He had it all going for him, but for some reason, wanted more. He always wanted more, and he always wanted it as fast as possible. Today that would just make you an asshole (or average, depending on where you live and your view of the world.) but in Robrecht, in those days, such a greedy, impatient lust for life could be very dangerous indeed. 

Boltac thought that he would teach his apprentice to handle one of the most tedious, dangerous and loathsome tasks that befell him as a shop keeper -- spotting bad coins. He sent the boy to make a delivery of healing potions to an Inn on the north side of town, trusting that he would manage to put himself, in flagrante delicto along the way and for the better part of the afternoon. Avarcious was well-liked by women young and old alike. And some days Boltac wondered if it was possible to get any work out of the lad at all. Beneath the usual and expected cursing of apprentices, Boltac was more than a little jealous of the lad. Even if he had had the good looks and endurance to pull off his amorous lifestyle, he wouldn't have. With the exception of matters of commerce, Boltac was painfully shy around the opposite sex.  

While the apprentice was out (have you forgotten his name yet? I certainly hope so. Don't fall for him and his boyish good looks. I'm warning you.) 
Boltac laid 20 gold coins across the top of his counter in a neat row. 

When Avaricous returned wearing a relaxed and healthy glow to match his hastily buttoned shirt, Boltac said, "Bar the door." The apprentice did as he was told and his greed drew him naturally to the counter where Boltac hunched over the coins. He gave the bits of currency a hard, searching look and said, "I know there's one in here. I can smell it."

"One what?"

"Bad money drives out good," he muttered. And then he commanded, "Watch them, make sure none of them move."

"What?"

"They creep before they pounce. The coins lad. The coins! Some of them are *alive*"

Avaricous began to laugh, but the laugh died in his throat when he could saw that his strange and serious master was more humorless than usual. 

"Magic, my boy, the dark, business end of magic." Boltac reached into a secret recess under the counter and produced a wand of dark wood banded with copper.

"Is that a magic wand?" the lad asked, already estimating how much it might be worth. 

"Not exactly," said Boltac, "It is a magic *detecting* wand. Hold this end near a magical object or creature and the other end gets hot. Usually hot enough to burn the holder."

"Ouch."

"That's the way it is with magic. It seems like a blessing but it usually turns out to be a curse." said Boltac as held the tip of the want over the first coin. "Years ago there was Wizard named Gresham. And in the way of Wizards, he kept a lot of money in a dark, secret dungeon." Boltac looked up to make sure still had his apprentice's attention. The subject was money, so Avarcious was riveted. 

He moved the wand to the next coin. "He got this money either from robbing caravans or from buying and selling potions." He looked up at me with a shrug, "Probably robbing." The tip of the wand moved to the next coin.

"So, word gets out, Gresham is a lot of coins. Next thing you know, every ne'er-do-well and layabout in the known Kingdoms comes to take a run at Gresham's horde. Ennh, I'm SURE there's one here," Boltac muttered as he moved to the next coin.

"Well, he got sick of it, see. I mean he was a wizard, after all. And with all these people barging into his business all the time, he couldn't get any wizarding done. So, the story goes, he made Creeping Coins. They look like regular coins. They spend like regular coins. But turn your back on a pile of them and -- A HA!" Boltac dropped the wand and shook his hand. 

Grabbing a pair of metal tongs, he warned Avacious, "Stand back, they don't like to be revealed." Boltac clamped the tongs down on the coin. To the boy's horror, the coin split in two and let out a high-pitched screech. Thin metal legs emerged from the side and clawed at the air. 

"Ah, I should have seen if from the beginning. You see how this one is darker than the rest? Yes, they start off silver and get darker as they get older. Camouflage, helps them blend in. Little bastards."

Boltac thrust the screeching, pecuniary thing in the iron tongs towards his apprentice and Avaricous could see it's triple rows of tiny metal teeth.  "And they eat real coins and breed. Leave one of these lying around in a chest full of money for a few months and by the time you come back, you've got a horde of these evil things gnawing you down to the bone. "

"So what do we do with it?"

"Eh, well, what can you do?" said Boltac with a shrug. "I mean, it's still money. I throw them down here with the rest of them." He clunked over to the far end of the counter and lifted a panel in the floor. Beneath the floor panel was was a heavy stone with piece of rope through it. Boltac lifted the heavy stone clear to reveal a vault below. Avaricous eye's grew wide. The stone receptacle beneath the floor was filled with golden coins. It was a fortune.

But as Boltac lowered the spindly coin creature into the vault, it's high pitched clicks and screeches began to wake the other coins. The top layer of coins began to wiggle, and split and grow legs in the most absurd, yet terrifying manor. Boltac released the coin and slid the heavy stone back over the vault. Then he replaced the floor and turned back to his apprentice. 

"How many of them do you have?" Avaricous asked. 

"More than you'd want to carry," said Boltac, "I've been taking them out of circulation for years. Nobody wants to admit they're carrying a gold piece that isn't worth anything. So I just mark up the price of everything. It's a poor merchant's only defense."

Poor merchant, thought Avarcious, who did Boltac think he was fooling?

Later that night, Boltac was awakened by screams. He rushed downstairs in time to see his apprentice's feet being pulled into the hole by a swarm of the coins. The boy's screams were overwhelmed by the sound of ripping flesh and metal teeth clicking together. Boltac slammed the stone back on the vault and spend the next hour chasing down fugitive coins with a blacksmith's hammer. 

He put the escaped coins in an apothecary's jar. And put them on a high shelf, out of harms way. He'd wait a few days before he put them back in the vault. Give the coins a chance to digest and multiply and return to their sinister sleep.  

Boltac never knew whether the boy had been curious, or planning to steal some of the Creeping Coins and make off with them in the night. He tried to feel a sense of loss. But, in the final accounting, he just had no use for an apprentice who never listened. And while he might not have missed Avaricious, he never tried to take an apprentice again. 

[^ken]: Ken being a strange word primarily used for describing the understanding of wizards. Since Wizards have so little understanding (relative to that which is out there to be understood) it is unlikely we will encounter this word again in our tale.

[^things]: Sorry about this unfortunate use of the word "things" here. If you know you know and if you don't, there's no point in rushing it. Enjoy growing up.

Boltac caught the coins in flagrant vescorii.

But he had happened upon it.


I have here a geeeeeenuine wand of fireball.

There is no saving throw against your own stupidity.

And some of them were magic. 




It started as a trading post at a crossroads in the high mountains. For factors beyond anyone in the towns control, the places at the other end of these roads sprang up into mighty kingdoms and empires. Which meant, somewhat paradoxically, that although Robrecht was a town in the middle of nowhere, it managed to be on the way to almost everywhere.
