The Merchant Adventurer
By Patrick E. McLean

# Chapter One: Good Money Drives Out Bad

Once upon a time there was a town called Robrecht. At first it was little more than a remote crossroads in the high mountains. But when traveller met traveller and one of them lifted his cloak and said, "Psst, buddy, wanna buy an hourglass," a trading post was born. 

As the years went by, the places at the far ends of the crossroads grew into mighty kingdoms and powerful empires. Which made Robrecht (now that it had grown big enough to have it's own name) something of a paradox; a town in the middle of nowhere, but on the way to everywhere. 

It was the kind of place that people would pass through and say, "Y'know, if I wanted to disappear, just leave all that nonsense behind me, this would be the place." So it slowly filled with wanders and wastrels and ne'er do wells and most importantly, for our story wizards.

Wizards, it is generally acknowledged, are a strange, solitary breed. Which is good because they meddle with powers beyond their ken. [^ken] They often die horrible, pyrotechnic deaths as they stumble around in the darkness of human ignorance searching for what they call knowledge but finding what normal, workaday people like you and I would call mistakes. 

So it was that the peaks and high valleys surrounding Robrecht became fairly littered with abandoned mines turned into dungeons, towers built by creatures constructed or enslaved, mysterious and powerful shrines, and a cautionary assortment of blast craters. In most of these places lurked death. But in a few them there was also treasure. So, in addition to being a natural hub of trade and commercial activity, Robrecht became a stepping off point for Adventurers of all shapes, sizes and abilities. 

In the very center of Robrecht was the market square. And on the southeast corner of the very center of Robrecht there was a sign that read "Boltac's Trading Post." Beneath the sign there was a store. And at the very heart of the store, sitting on a high stool behind a wide oak counter was a short man with shaved head and large belly named Boltac. 

While many buyers and sellers came to Robrecht on market day, Boltac's was the only permenent store in town. What kind of a store did he have? What kind of a store didn't he have? Boltac bought and sold everything an adventurer might need for what ever ill-advised expedition he or she might be embarking on. For those of you who have spent your daydreams raiding deep dungeons, high towers and far castles, you know what this includes. For everyone else there is the next paragraph. 

Boltac bought and sold all manner of weapons, armor, scrolls, potions, projectiles, charms, jewelry, comestibles, any tools -- anything any everything an adventurer might need for plumbing the depths of a dungeon and removing it's contents from the rightful owners. As a keen salesman, he preyed upon the fear and greed of his customers. But mostly the fear. Setting off into the unknown, by definition is a fearful business.

"Do I really need and ointment to protect myself from Xagreeptian Spider Bites. Xagreep is a thousand miles to the south?" a customer might reasonably ask.

"Better to have it and not need it. Than need it and not have it," Boltac would reply. 'My only concern is your safety and well being." Boltac was also inordinately fond of saying, "And don't forget your torches!" 

Mixed in among the ointments and unguents, flails and morningstars, bucklers and plate mail were some items which were *genuinely* magical. Given the dangers of Wizardry, genuinely magical items were quite rare, but they did exist. The problem was, most of them were cursed. 

For example, Magrief's infamous Gauntlets of Self-Abuse. To the untrained eye, they appeared to be nothing more than an exceptionally high quality pair of metal gloves. But once donned, they forced the wearer to constantly and ceaselessly do unsavory things to themselves. [^things] In his earlier days Boltac had been sold a pair of these gloves by traveller. With the native cunning of all shopkeepers, he had seen fit to identify them before putting them on. 

Of all the great legendary Wizards of Robrecht's storied past, Boltac held a special grudge against Magrief. Magrief had done something which no other wizard had dared to do. Not only had he did he manage to create magical items, but he created an entire race of magical creatures. 

Very few people knew of the existence of these creeping coins, there being fewer banks in those days. But they were terrible and terribly dangerous. In fact, they had cost Boltac his one and only apprentice. 

Boltac's apprentice was named was Avarcious, but he's not going to live very long in this story, so there's not really reason for you to remember his name. He had sandy blonde hair, bright blue eyes and smile that seemed to make everyone's spirits and skirts lift. He had it all going for him, but for some reason, wanted more. He always wanted more, and he always wanted it as fast as possible. Today that would just make you an asshole (or average, depending on where you live and your view of the world.) but in Robrecht, in those days, such a greedy, impatient lust for life could be very dangerous indeed. 

Boltac thought that he would teach his apprentice to handle one of the most tedious, dangerous and loathsome tasks that befell him as a shop keeper -- spotting bad coins. He sent the boy to make a delivery of healing potions to an Inn on the north side of town, trusting that he would manage to put himself, in flagrante delicto along the way and for the better part of the afternoon. Avarcious was well-liked by women young and old alike. And some days Boltac wondered if it was possible to get any work out of the lad at all. Beneath the usual and expected cursing of apprentices, Boltac was more than a little jealous of the lad. Even if he had had the good looks and endurance to pull off his amorous lifestyle, he wouldn't have. With the exception of matters of commerce, Boltac was painfully shy around the opposite sex.  

While the apprentice was out (have you forgotten his name yet? I certainly hope so. Don't fall for him and his boyish good looks. I'm warning you.) 
Boltac laid 20 gold coins across the top of his counter in a neat row. 

When Avaricous returned wearing a relaxed and healthy glow to match his hastily buttoned shirt, Boltac said, "Bar the door." The apprentice did as he was told and his greed drew him naturally to the counter where Boltac hunched over the coins. He gave the bits of currency a hard, searching look and said, "I know there's one in here. I can smell it."

"One what?"

"Bad money drives out good," he muttered. And then he commanded, "Watch them, make sure none of them move."

"What?"

"They creep before they pounce. The coins lad. The coins! Some of them are *alive*"

Avaricous began to laugh, but the laugh died in his throat when he could saw that his strange and serious master was more humorless than usual. 

"Magic, my boy, the dark, business end of magic." Boltac reached into a secret recess under the counter and produced a wand of dark wood banded with copper.

"Is that a magic wand?" the lad asked, already estimating how much it might be worth. 

"Not exactly," said Boltac, "It is a magic *detecting* wand. Hold this end near a magical object or creature and the other end gets hot. Usually hot enough to burn the holder."

"Ouch."

"That's the way it is with magic. It seems like a blessing but it usually turns out to be a curse." said Boltac as held the tip of the want over the first coin. "Years ago there was Wizard named Gresham. And in the way of Wizards, he kept a lot of money in a dark, secret dungeon." Boltac looked up to make sure still had his apprentice's attention. The subject was money, so Avarcious was riveted. 

He moved the wand to the next coin. "He got this money either from robbing caravans or from buying and selling potions." He looked up at me with a shrug, "Probably robbing." The tip of the wand moved to the next coin.

"So, word gets out, Gresham is a lot of coins. Next thing you know, every ne'er-do-well and layabout in the known Kingdoms comes to take a run at Gresham's horde. Ennh, I'm SURE there's one here," Boltac muttered as he moved to the next coin.

"Well, he got sick of it, see. I mean he was a wizard, after all. And with all these people barging into his business all the time, he couldn't get any wizarding done. So, the story goes, he made Creeping Coins. They look like regular coins. They spend like regular coins. But turn your back on a pile of them and -- A HA!" Boltac dropped the wand and shook his hand. 

Grabbing a pair of metal tongs, he warned Avacious, "Stand back, they don't like to be revealed." Boltac clamped the tongs down on the coin. To the boy's horror, the coin split in two and let out a high-pitched screech. Thin metal legs emerged from the side and clawed at the air. 

"Ah, I should have seen if from the beginning. You see how this one is darker than the rest? Yes, they start off silver and get darker as they get older. Camouflage, helps them blend in. Little bastards."

Boltac thrust the screeching, pecuniary thing in the iron tongs towards his apprentice and Avaricous could see it's triple rows of tiny metal teeth.  "And they eat real coins and breed. Leave one of these lying around in a chest full of money for a few months and by the time you come back, you've got a horde of these evil things gnawing you down to the bone. "

"So what do we do with it?"

"Eh, well, what can you do?" said Boltac with a shrug. "I mean, it's still money. I throw them down here with the rest of them." He clunked over to the far end of the counter and lifted a panel in the floor. Beneath the floor panel was was a heavy stone with piece of rope through it. Boltac lifted the heavy stone clear to reveal a vault below. Avaricous eye's grew wide. The stone receptacle beneath the floor was filled with golden coins. It was a fortune.

But as Boltac lowered the spindly coin creature into the vault, it's high pitched clicks and screeches began to wake the other coins. The top layer of coins began to wiggle, and split and grow legs in the most absurd, yet terrifying manor. Boltac released the coin and slid the heavy stone back over the vault. Then he replaced the floor and turned back to his apprentice. 

"How many of them do you have?" Avaricous asked. 

"More than you'd want to carry," said Boltac, "I've been taking them out of circulation for years. Nobody wants to admit they're carrying a gold piece that isn't worth anything. So I just mark up the price of everything. It's a poor merchant's only defense."

Poor merchant, thought Avarcious, who did Boltac think he was fooling?

Later that night, Boltac was awakened by screams. He rushed downstairs in time to see his apprentice's feet being pulled into the hole by a swarm of the coins. The boy's screams were overwhelmed by the sound of ripping flesh and metal teeth clicking together. Boltac slammed the stone back on the vault and spend the next hour chasing down fugitive coins with a blacksmith's hammer. 

He put the escaped coins in an apothecary's jar. And put them on a high shelf, out of harms way. He'd wait a few days before he put them back in the vault. Give the coins a chance to digest and multiply and return to their sinister sleep.  

Boltac never knew whether the boy had been curious, or planning to steal some of the Creeping Coins and make off with them in the night. He tried to feel a sense of loss. But, in the final accounting, he just had no use for an apprentice who never listened. And while he might not have missed Avaricious, he never tried to take an apprentice again. 

[^ken]: Ken being a strange word primarily used for describing the understanding of wizards. Since Wizards have so little understanding (relative to that which is out there to be understood) it is unlikely we will encounter this word again in our tale.

[^things]: Sorry about this unfortunate use of the word "things" here. If you know you know and if you don't, there's no point in rushing it. Enjoy growing up. 

# CHAPTER 2: Roads to Robrecht

I must tell you about the roads that lead to Robrecht.

You may think that your modern roads are better constructed or more advanced but I assure you, they are not. They are more regular. They are wider. But no roads in the history of the world have ever been or will ever be more daring than the roads that lead through the Harsburgian Mountains. More than feats of engineering, they are feats of human daring that may never be repeated. 

To understand them, ask yourself, how would your turn a footpath chiseled into the side of a sheer cliff into a road big enough for a wagon. If you are like Boltac, your answer should be, "I'd hire it done!" But, if you are like an engineer, consider the problem. And now consider that the only steel there is in the world is reserved for making implements suitable for sticking in fearsome creatures and fearsome people. In fact, the manufacture of steel is a closely guarded secret[^riddle] and regarded as a wizardry all it's own. 

So you use iron, rope, wood and courage. You employ brave men to climb out on the rock face and drive bars of iron into the mountain. To these bars you attach ropes. And to the ropes you attach the edge of the wooden roadway. Yes, that is correct. The wooden planks of the road hang out in space, over impossible drops and defiles. Mule and wagon trains must inch their way across boards (rotten?) held by ropes (rotten?) over perilous defiles (lethal).

Travel is dangerous and difficult, but commerce (like it's more painful and expensive cousin, love) always finds a way. But just like love, commerce also ends in disaster. 

"Well," said Boltac as he looked down at wreckage of three wagons scattered along the banks of the river Swift[^Swift] thundering far, far below, "I'm not paying for that shipment." He inspected what was left of the East/South road. Men with fresh ropes and planks were already reconstructing the section of roadway that had given way. Even though he weighed much, much less than the wagons that had broken the roadway, he was uneasy standing on anything that shifted with the breeze.

The freight agent standing next to him said, "I brought you out here so you could understand. It's nobody's fault. An accident you see." He smiled at Boltac, but his smile faded when he saw that Boltac's expression seemed less likely to change than the granite face next to which they stood. "So you'll have to make good on your portion of the shipment."

"Sorry, that's not in the contract," said Boltac. 

"Contract?" said the freight agent. "But we don't have a contract! You just said you'd pay."

"Exactly," said Boltac, "I said I'd pay for goods delivered to my store. I didn't say I would pay for the stupidity of your teamsters." 

"But, but, they weren't. I mean to say, you assumed the risk."

"Oh no," said Boltac, waving a finger, "You assumed I assumed the risk. And you assumed wrong. Very risky to assume." 

"You can't do this!"

"That's right," said Boltac smiling into the cold, damp wind. "I can't pay for your error. If I paid every time someone make a mistake, I'd be out of business."

"This is outrageous. I will take you before the Duke! Let us see how you fare before his justice."

"Fine," said Boltac, "Take me anywhere you like solid on solid ground," and then Boltac waddled around the bend and back to his carriage as quickly as his flat feet would carry him. 

# CHAPTER THREE: In the Company of Heroes

When he got back to town, Boltac headed for the nearest inn. It happened to be across the street from his shop. It was a dismal looking placed named the Bent Eelpout. It was far from the nicest accommodations in town, but Boltac liked it there. Primarily because he was in love with the owner, a woman named Asarah.  

The inn took it's name from a spectacularly ugly fish that lived in the depths of Lake Robrecht. 

The view meant the owner and proprietoress, Asarah. She was beautiful woman with

He walked up the to bar and cried, "Help, I am gravely wounded!" The entire room turned their heads. Could this be the ADVENTURE they had been waiting for.Boltac sneered at the ill-equipped rabble spread out in varying states of sobriety throughout the inn. "They got me right in the wallet. And only ale can dull the pain of so grave a wound."




"Sir, it is not wise to joke when there be such mighty heroes --"

"and Heroines!" screeched a voice from the back.

"and Heroines present."

"Oh, well, I am sorry." Boltac said with exaggerated politeness, "I was not aware I was in the presence of, uh greatness. I will be certain to make a full apology as soon as I see one of them."

"You have offended the honor of one of the line of Castogere. For generations we brave few have been the protectors of power and secret so deep,"

Boltac sighed. He should have left well enough alone. Now he wasn't going to get a minute's peace. As the dark-haired idiot droned on he mouthed to Asarah,"help me." She smiled and somehow managed to shrug at him from under a heavy tray of ale. 

"Brave men, worth men who have laid down their lives in the name of the sacred T'pahhh," the man continued, his chest filling with pride, or perhaps bullshit.

Boltac considered the man's battered and abused breastplate. It had been hammered back into shape and polished to a high shine, but it was low-quality item if ever there was one. No matter how pretty you made it, it wouldn't hold up to the thrust of even the cheapest sword. And there, look at the ties holding it together on the right side. They were nearly worn through.  

"You, sir, will do honor to a knight, or an order of knights so bold," he droned on until he finally got the punchline, "or I will have my satisfaction."  

"Oh, it's satisfaction you're after?" asked Boltac. "Well, why didn't you just say so." He took at tiny, dull butter knife from the counter and brandished it at the "Knight of Dubious Accouterments." 

The Knight threw back his head and laughed? "You mean to assault one so mighty as me with a butter knife?"

Boltac slid the tiny knife into the seam of the breastplate and jerked downward sharply. All of the worn leather ties snapped and the brestplate fell off and clattered on the floor. Underneath the breastplate the knight wore a ragged shirt of torn linen. A few barks of laughter rang out in the inn. When Boltac saw the man's shoulders fall in defeat, he almost felt sorry for him. Almost. 

"Come across the street and I'll give you a deal on a new tunic," said Boltac but what he meant was -- come into my parlor, little fly, so I can sell you some schmatta on markup."  

For a moment, he thought he had gone too far. That he large, earnest lad from the country 


"Easy 'Liam

# CHAPTER -- Asarah and the Chosen Ones

Asarah wiped a table clean. Well, as clean as she could. The pile of tallow candles in the center of the table had melted and congealed into a mass of light-giving wax. The best she could manage was to push some of the dirt further into the top layer of wax. Her rag stopped as she paused to dig a copper piece out from the wax. The tips that came at the Bent Eelpout didn't come often, and when they did, they were like as not to be stolen before she reached them. So to find the penny in it's fossilized state was something of an unexpected gift. Either she rushed to the ringing of coins as they hit the table, or she didn't get them at all. It was one of the many reasons, good help was hard for Asarah to come by. 

That, and people were conniving thieving bastards.





"If I could have defeated that lock spell, I'd be a wealthy man."

"A Dragon? Who'd have thought ye'd find a Dragon in East Reach? And at this time of year?"

"Lucky to have escaped with our lives."

# CHAPTER 


"If you please, good merchant, I have something I would like to sell," Boltac looked up from behind the counter.

"Ah, Rattick," said Boltac,  

He turned to his right and beheld Rattick, too large and too watery eyes trying to fool him with their great sincerity. The glowed like great moons of reassurance. So dazzling they were that it was difficult to notice the pale, dead face that never smiled around them. Or, Boltac assumed, the knife that was coming to slit the strings on your coinpurse. 

"Ah Rattick," he said, "Have you taken those poor fools last coin before they could drink it." 

"No," Rattick sighed with great sincerity, "but if I had, just if mind you, would that be so terrible? So parasitic? After all, we are all suffering from an economic downturn of such proportion, such magnitude, that bringing coin here to Robrecht and keeping it here, why it is a matter of our very survival. 

"Economic? That's a very large word for you Rattick," Boltac said. 

"You should not be so unkind to me, stout merchant. Besides, it would be a sin to let them take their coin with them on their planned outing 

"It seems a sin to let them wander off into the hills and die, leaving their remaining coin festering at the bottom of some dark fen, troll pit or bottomless chasm." At this, Boltac clinked glasses with the weasel of a man sitting next to him. He might have been shady, disreputable, but he wasn't wrong. Besides, the man was thief. It was his job. And unlike all of the other adventurers who festered and waited in Robrecht -- Rattick was actually good at what he did. 

"Yes, you see that one there," Rattick continued, "The one with the pan for a helmet. Yes, he is the *chosen one*."

"Ah, of course, sent to to free us from the awful shadow of the wizard who has occupied the nearby tower."

"Cavern, actually. Rumor has it the old Matteschitz mine collapsed into a gigantic, secret cavern in the earth."

"Oh, ah, of course. Cavern. How silly of me," said Boltac.

"And even know, the great wizard Oddna searches beneath the earth for relics and powers of which man was not meant to know." 

"Which, will inevitably bring about the destruction of all of the Duchy of Robrecht," said Boltac, filling in the next verse. And recognizing it for the lie it was. He had never met the Wizard Oddna, and hoped he never would -- he hated magic in a way that only a trader with a lust for certain, right and ordinary commerce can. -- but if a man wanted to dig for objects in the earth, why shouldn't he? As for the tales of horrible things happening and monsters roaming the land, Boltac couldn't help but notice that these stories, and the twisted corpses and wrecked adventurers who had retunred, had only started turning up after adventurers had gone out in search of Oddna's loot. Boltac knew what he would do to anyone he caught robbing his store...

"Yes, but of course. But thankfully, the chosen one is here to save us."

"Hmm, thankfully."

"Only, there is one, unexpected problem for this auspicious young man on his world-healing hero quest."

"Yes,"

"You see the tall one, in the Mage's robe."

"Yes, the one covered in silly mystical symbols as only a true mage can be?"

"Yes. Turns out, he's the chosen one. Too."

"Ahh, so the chosen two."

"Yes, I fear it will not end well for their party, but enough of the misfortunes of others. I have a certain item that I have come into possession of a certain item which I am certain you will be interested."

"Step into my office," said Boltac, as he slid off the stool and made his way to the door. But not before casting a longing look towards the kitchen. What would

potions
And some of them were magic. 




It started as a trading post at a crossroads in the high mountains. For factors beyond anyone in the towns control, the places at the other end of these roads sprang up into mighty kingdoms and empires. Which meant, somewhat paradoxically, that although Robrecht was a town in the middle of nowhere, it managed to be on the way to almost everywhere.
