# Chapter One - The Apprentice

When I met Boltac I was starving to death. I was a masterless boy running riot through the kingdom of my own life. My mother, perhaps, had died in childbirth. My father, perhaps, had been killed in a war, or drowned in a well or run off. Perhaps they had been changed into deer or made to vanish in a puff of smoke. Those were the far different days, when more thing were possible and many more things were actual. 

Yes, I speak of magic, in all it's wonder and horror. I remember the time when it was real. And, if we speak the truth here by the fire, magic was far more terrible than the stories would have you believe. It came at such a price, and that price was not paid by the powerful, but by the small, the ordinary and the orphaned. 

I cannot that all magic is gone from the world or will never return. Perhaps it is a like the fires of summer. Years can pass without a whiff of smoke. Then, for no reason known to us, the world bursts into flame. Mayhap the fires are necessary, part of some larger cycle beyond our ken. But for ordinary people, the kind who enjoy loud stories on a quiet evening, the world is a better place without the uncontrolled fire of magic. 

In the time of magic there was more hunger in the world. Which makes sense, Hunger is kind a magic all it's own. Go even one day without eating and your sense of smell will become so acute, your sense of hearing so attuned, that droplets of fat sizzling on a hot piece of charcoal will cause physical pain. Though nothing outward touches your body, the magic of hunger will work it's changes. Your mouth will fill with juice, your eyes will grow wide and your will will weaken.

I must have been as obvious as dawn, a dirty child shuffling in circles on the stone of the marketplace. No parent or guardian to restrain him. The sunken eyes of hunger. The ground-in, animal dirt of one who slept in a pile of sticks and dirty straw against the outer wall. The mystery was not how I got caught but how I thought I would ever have gotten away with it in the first place. 

I sighted a line between me, the meat and the lower exit of the marketplace. I could see my entry and my exit. But that meant that everyone else could too. 

With more planning, with better organization. If I had blended in with a pack of children running through the market -- laughing and taunting each other -- then I would have stood a chance. But one, rail-thin, deadly serious child, his feet feet sped by the magic of hunger --  Well, how could anyone not see that coming?

The man and master of the sausage cart did not try to stop me in my mad rush. While I was only aware of the sizzling food, I'm certain he watched me run all the way in. He let me to sear my hand upon a piece of delicious meat. He waited until the crowd parted and believed home free. Until I could almost taste that piece of cow or rabbit or rat or whatever it was. 

Then, he tripped me. 

My head bounced off the dirty stones of the marketplace. The  glorious, greasy hunk of stolen meat slid out of my hand and off into the crowd. I struggled to regain my my feet, but my vision was dark around the edges and I couldn't seem to stand. The Man of Sausages, put his foot on my stomach and leaned in. "Steal from me, will you?"

"Ennnnhguh," was my reply as all of the air was forced out of my chest. 

If Boltac had not intervened -- no let me say it plain -- if he hadn't saved me, I don't know what awful fate I would have met. The days of magic were far, far less kind. All of the old stories should teach you that. Good children of loving families were always getting eaten by wolves, trapped by witches or stolen by Faeries (oh yes, they were real) What chance did an orphan have? 

My certain murder was interrupted by a man I could not see. He said, "Oh Alvasir, you fierce man you! Now what are you going to do with the starving boy now that you've caught him?"

"I should murder the little thieveling," said the man standing on my chest. He wasn't joking, but the other man laughed anyway. 

"You? Murder! Why think of the scandal!"

"What scandal? Who would miss this bastard boy?"

"Who's talking about the boy, ya yutz? Whattya gonna do to get rid of the body?"

"The River Swift keeps all secrets," he said ominously.

"Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute," the voice said, in a hurry that bespoke confusion, "For the price of a piece of, we'll generously call what you sell meat, you're going to wrench that boy's neck -- "

"Stomp his guts out, rather."

"Sweaty work, either way. Then while haul him up the hill to the canyon and throw him down into the river, right in the middle of the day, in the middle of town, in front of everyone?"

"I would do it under cover of night."

"Oh, cover of night? That's good, you're inner criminal mastermind is certainly coming into it's own. And what do you think that is going to do for sales of your, uh, simulated sausage-product?"

"It will cut my losses. Word will get out, Rumpustle Alvasir is not a man to be trifled with," said the man as he sank more of his weight into me..

"Rumpustle. Rum-pustle," said the man as if he was rolling the name around in his mouth to see how it tasted.

"What's wrong with Rumpustle?"

"With the name, nothing. With you... eeeeeh. Look, 'Pustle. Can I call you 'Pustle? Think it through. See it with me now." With this a belly surmounted by a triple-chin came into view. My unknown savior put his arm around the man who wanted to kill me. A little of the weight came off my stomach.  

"You are a sausage man. A sausage Monger. A vendor of food for hungry market-goers? I am right?"

"Yes, but..."

"But? There is no but. You sell sausage! It's a noble calling. But, if you stomp this poor, unfortunate child's guts out, business will suffer."

"Business?"

"Whattya got, like four, five more hours of daylight. That means his rotting corpse is gonna lie here in hot sun for hours. And anyone who wants to buy a sausage is going to have to track through his intestines to get lunch. And, y'know who wants to do that? Nobody. Stomp this kid flat and ya sales are gonna take a hit. And then, at the end of a long, profitless day, you still have to carry his body up the hill, and vffffp, into the river. That is, if the city watch doesn't get you first."

While this was going on, I managed to wiggle, ever so slightly, out from under 'Pustle's foot. I had hoped that I might make an escape and perhaps find the sausage in the dirt. If I could but get my hip bone past the ball of his foot. 

"The city watch and I have an arrangement," 'Pustle said proudly. 

"You give them your sausages? It's a wonder they haven't arrested you for murder?"

"What do you mean?" said the man, sounding hurt. I squirmed a little more.

"Look, never mind the boy. Just like you sausages, any way you slice 'em, it's just not worth it."

"I will have my satisfaction!" said 'Pustle, stomping his foot into my spleen again. "That's worth more than any money."

"Really? More than money?" asked a skeptical Boltac. 

"No, no. You fat cripple, do not try your negotiation magic on me. The boy has stolen from me. At the very least, I will give him a good beating for my troubles."

"Ah, so there is room to negotiate!" said Boltac.

"No, I just told you, I will not negotiate!"

"Yes, but you just changed your position. A minute ago, you said, 'I'm going to stomp the life out of this boy,' but now, you've dropped down to a more reasonable beating."

"Excuse me?" I said. 

"Shut up," said Boltac, "You should never negotiate for yourself. Remember that, it's Rule Number One."


So it was that I became apprenticed to Boltac, the shopkeeper of Robrecht. In addition to using his legendary negotiation skills to save me from being killed and dumped in the river -- or, now that I think of it, the sausage grinder -- he had managed to negotiate an exclusive Writ of Vendor. Merchants were welcome in marketplace, provided they paid the tax, but only Boltac could warehouse and showcase his goods in fixed location. 

<!-- And to this day I don't know why -->

I don't know why it was that he saved me, and in all the years we were together, he would never tell me. But he prided himself on seeing the value in things that other people overlooked. So perhaps. Ah, but I am an old man flattering himself. He recognized that I was in no position to negotiate and that my loyalty could be bought for a few words and the price of meal. 

He bought me, more or less, out from under the foot of 'Pustle the Sausage Monger. And then, before I even had time to say thank you, he had me by the arm and was hustling me up the hill. Not that I would have had a chance to say thank you. At most times, a river of words poured from Boltac. It was in this constant flow that the bright, darting fish of his wit and skill did it's work. From years of close observation, I came to understand one of his finest negotiation tactics. He simply washed objections away with words.  

He told me, "Rule number one. Don't steal. Rule number two, if you are going to steal, make sure you grab something that's worth something."

I was confused about rule number one. I had known the man less than five minutes and already there were two rule number ones. "But I was hungry," I began.

"Well, you were certainly on your way to solving that problem, weren't you? Dead men tell no tales. And they eat no sandwiches."

# Something to Eat

"Ah, there she is, my flagship store," said Boltac with pride as he indicated his shop. It was a two story, mud and timber-framed building with narrow, intricately paned-glass windows. The door was large enough that it had it's own smaller door in the center of it. At first I though that Boltac would be too large to fit through it, but when he turned his broad shoulders sideways, his gut fit the curve of the arched mini-doorway perfectly. 

The rest of the store fit him just as well. He bustled around, stirred the fire in the fireplace, lit the heavy, hanging oil lamps  brushed some dust off the counter, then, having set his domain to right, turned his gaze to me. 

"Wait there, I have just the thing." He disappeared into the back. Leaving me to take it all in. At the time, the store seemed limitless. I was smaller then, and this was surely the greatest display of wealth I had ever seen in one place. The small room was filled with tables and shelves and hanging racks. Every inch was packed with something. There were potions of every color and size imaginable on one wall. A barrel of torches next to a barrel of pitch. There were an assortment of battered helmets and swords and knives and maces and instruments of mayhem of almost every size and shape imaginable. 

My eye was held by a gigantic curved sword that hung behind the counter. 

Boltac returned to the from the back with a chair. He set it down on the side of the counter. "There you go. Everything needs a place, you see."

He followed my gaze to the blade behind the counter. "Ah yes, the Balabomo. An adventurer from the far, far south sold that to me, on his way back from a unsuccessful conquest. Told me it was a priceless sword, a legendary enchanted blade of his ancestors. I told him I couldn't buy anything that didn't have a price. Do you like it?"

I nodded, both attracted and repulsed the wicked blade. 

"It's utter garbage. Balabomo -- eh, a load of cheap tin if ever there was one. It would shatter on the first swing. I'm surprised it doesn't shatter when you look at it. But when he sung his sad tale of woe, I got sucked in. I overpaid for that. I hang it there as a reminder. Never again have I let myself get took."

My eyes scanned the rest of the store. Boltac said, "What? You don't like my store? It's not good enough for you or something?"

"No," I said, mortified, "It's just. I thought you said we were going to get something to eat." I suppose it was a little rude to talk to my recent savior like this, but I couldn't help it. I wanted to forget the sausage in the marketplace, but my stomach wouldn't let me. It was all I could do to keep from eating my hand.

"Ah, and so I did. I can't have an apprentice starving to death. That would be bad for business. C'mon, I'll take you to the best place in town."

I followed him outside and waited while he locked up the store again.

"If we're not there, isn't it bad for business?" I asked, trying to make up for rude comment about food. 

"Ehhh, you're eager. I like that. Remember, you've got to take care you your health. If you don't have your health, you've got nothing. That's Rule Number One."

I walked after Boltac has he hobbled towards the inn across the street. The statues you see around Robrecht these days show him standing straight and tall, with a full head of hair and a much flatter belly than he had. And they betray no sign at all of his crippled leg. I guess when you become a hero, you're not allowed to walk with a limp anymore. 

He entered a dubious-looking building which a sign proclaimed as "The Inn of the Bent Eelpout." Have you ever seen an Eelpout? I mean up close and personal. It is perhaps the ugliest fish known to man. And the painting of the fish on the Inn's sign was distressingly faithful to nature. An Eelpout, rampant against a field of dingy brown, jutted it's lower jaw out in away that dared (rather than invited) people to patronize this Inn. 

Much to the curses and distress of fisherman, Eelpout were plentiful in Lake Halikai. Mostly scales and bad tasting meat, they survived on seemingly anything, so that they crowded out the fish that were worth catching. Only the poorest sort ate Eelpout. In the poor, unfortunate state of my youth, I had looked up to those with Eelpout. They had all manner of things I lacked. Roofs, blankets, shoes -- but that didn't mean I thought that damn fish tasted good. Even when starving, it always tasted awful to me. 

As I pushed though the door, I saw that the Inn looked even worse on the inside. There room was lit by smoking, sputtering oil lamps. In the shadows created by the lamps feeble lights, people huddled around low tables. In the corner a minstrel played a sad tune on a sad lute. His voice was low and gravelly and the song he sang was about loss and despair. 

Eyes peered at me over tankards and from dark corners. Fingers danced with daggers and I heard the muttering of flawed spells and the clanking of mismatched armor as the room sized me up. From the bar, Boltac cried, "Boy! Over here."

fire was sputtering and dying in the hearth. A silence fell across the room as I stood in the doorway. The room was filled with people that even I could see were the shoddiest sort of adventurers and neer-do-wells.

Eyes peered at me over tankards and from dark corners. Fingers danced with daggers and I heard the muttering of flawed spells and the clanking of mismatched armor as the room sized me up. Was I something to fear or something to frighten?

The horrible spell was broken when, Boltac cried, "Boy! Over here."

As I joined him at the bar, the in returned to normal. As I made my way to Boltac, I could hear the language of desperation and failure spoken from every corner. 

"If I could have defeated that lock spell, I'd be a wealthy man."

"A Dragon? Who'd have thought ye'd find a Dragon in East Reach? And at this time of year?"

"Lucky to have escaped with our lives."

Boltac clapped a hand on my shoulder and said, "Here you will find the finest Mutton Lettuce and Tomato sandwich in all of Robrecht. Sit and we will eat."

As I climbed on to the high stool I asked Boltac, "Who are all these people."

"Adventurers," said Boltac, "Heroes! CUSTOMERS!"

"Adventurers? What do they do?"

Boltac leaned in and said quietly, "Mostly nothing. They sit around and drink and plan and tell tales. And every once and a while, usually when the money runs out for drink, they they set out in search of loot."

"They're bandits?"

"No, no, no," said Boltac with a look of horror on his face. "Well, yes. You see in the mountains of Robrecht there are many many places and people that a normal person should leave alone. There are ancient tombs, abandoned castles, a lost city -- two that I know of -- a tribe of secretive elves in the south, dungeons filled with treasure, we even had a Dragon, but he died awhile back."

"Someone killed a Dragon? There is a Dragonslayer among us?"

"Nah, the Dragon died of old age. But a lotta people wanted to be Dragonslayers. I sold a lotta burn ointment. And the Blacksmith and I made a fortune off Dragon-proof shields."

"There are shields that can stop a DragonsFire?"

"Well, no, that was just the brand-name. When you get right down to it, there's nuttin' and nobody that can stop a Dragon. Huge beast, weighs as much as 20 bulls, yet it can FLY. And it breathes searing fire on command. A dragon isn't a creature as much as it is a civilization wrecking force of nature."

Boltac leaned in close and whispered, "But the fact that they didn't have a chance just seemed to make hopeless fools like these want to take run at the Dragon."

"They wanted to be heroes." I said.

"Nah. They wanted the treasure. The horde. You see Dragons gather together lots and lots of treasure, shiny valuable things -- they're like crows. Really big, incredibly dangerous, limitlessly greedy crows. What usually happens is, somebody finds the Dragons horde, steals something from it. Then the Dragon gets angry and razes the countryside.

"But this time was a little different. Sure the Dragon was marauding through the country side -- eating travelers, burning the occasional farm of village, but there was no horde. At least, no horde that the Dragon knew about. He was so old, he had gone senile, you see. He went out one day, and couldn't remember where his lair was."

"But..." I said in a vain attempt to get a word in edgewise.

"I know, I know. It's unbelievably sad. I think people just harassed the poor Dragon so much he died just so he could get some peace and quiet.

"But that's not my point. See, Dragon or no, the story is always the same. It could be a Wizard, a Noble Clan of Industrious Dwarves, pack of Werepeople, what have you. They're minding their own business. Along comes some party of adventurers -- pack of thieves -- who decides that whatever the Wizard, Dwarves or Werepeople have should belong to them.

"So they take it. And naturally, feelings are hurt, redress of wrongs is sought and then the Werewolves come down out of the high valleys and eat an innocent village."

"What happens to the adventurers? They get away with it?"

"Not exactly. They come back here and they have to sell their ill-gotten gains. So they come to good old Boltac, who always eager to buy. You know to help out a brave hero (or thief) as the case may be.Then they spend the coin I give them on drinking and wenching and gaming, until they are broke again. And the whole cycle starts over.

"They never seem to settle down, buy a farm, raise a family. They're just head right back at it until they die, usually alone, outnumbered and their mutliated corpse is eaten by slime molds deep in some hole in the ground."

"That's sad," I said.  

"Eh, there are worse ways to go. Besides, it provides me with a comfortable living." Boltac grabbed an empty tankard from where it sat on the bar, raised it and said, "To ADVENTURING!" The room responded with a variety of drunken cheers and huzzahs! He sat back down and said, "See? They're happy. I'm happy. Everybody is happy."

"Why Boltac, I didn't see you come in!" I turned to see a beautiful woman with long, dark hair emerging from the back of the inn. Boltac tucked his chin and whispered, "Just play along." The he turned to the woman and said, "Ah, Asarah, you look as radiant as ever." 

She looked at me and winked conspiratorially. "That's very sweet my fat merchant, by compliments don't pay your bar tab."

"Tab? Tab? Why I am shocked? This is the first I've heard of it -- Boltac pays his way."

"It's four coppers an ale, Boltac."

"But I had a half."

"We pour wholes."

"Well, you can't fault me for irregularities in your pricing scheme," said Boltac. 

Although they sounded like they were arguing with each other, I could see that they both enjoyed this exchange very much. 

"You give a discount for widows and orphans, don't you?"

"Why," asked the woman, "Which one are you pretending to be?" she asked with a wicked gleam in her eye.

"Why me? Ah no. I, ask, because, all of the other Inns in town, y'know, they do..."

"Is he with you, then?" she asked, flipping the rag she was using to wipe down the bar in my direction. 

"He is. Meet my new apprentice..."

Boltac stared at me. I looked back and forth between Boltac and Asarah. 

"Aren't you going to tell me his name?" asked Asarah. 

"Aren't you going to tell the woman your name?" said Boltac. Covering up for the fact that he didn't actually know my name.

"Relan," I said.

"There you go," said Boltac, "Relan. A likely boy for the finest merchant in all of Robrecht."

"You pick an apprentice and you don't even know his name? Where did you get him, then? Are you bringing home strays then. And why doesn't the poor thing dressed in rags?"

"Well, he was stealing food in the marketplace."

"Stealing food, the poor dear are you that hungry?"

I nodded. 

"Stealing from Rumpustle,"

"Well, that might be stealing," she said with a very serious look, "But that's hardly stealing food."

"I bought him, so to speak, out from under Rumpustle's foot."

"You did what?" she asked.

"He was threating to make him into sausages."

With that Asarah's mock smile turned into a real smile and her eyes grew wide. "Why Boltac. Crusty old Boltac, for all your hard bargaining, I'd never have thought it. You're an old softy."

"I am no such thing," Boltac protested, "I acquired an apprentice on the cheap. And if he's not hardworking, it's off to the sausage grinder with him."

I looked up to see if he was kidding about the sausage grinder. He looked serious, but Asarah just laughed as she filled a tankard with ale. She set it in front of Boltac and said. "On the house. You're a hard man, Messer Boltac." Then she put her her hand on his cheek, and kissed the side of his face. "But underneath it all, you're a sweetheart."

As she walked away, she said, "Two of the usual then."

Boltac grunted strangely. Asarah didn't look back to see that he was blushing uncomfortably, but I'm pretty sure she knew the effect that she had on him. 

When she returned, the sandwich she brought me was the finest thing I had ever eaten. And as I look back on it, it still may be. 



# The Chosen Two. 

I soon fell into the routine of a merchant's life. Every morning I swept the front of the store. Every evening I swept the front of the store. In between, I did what Boltac asked of me. Usually running errands and making deliveries.

The worst of it was not the running about town or the sweeping up. It was counting coins. And not even the counting of coins. I had never seen so much money in my life, so it took quite a while for the excitement of handling it to wear off. No, it was the testing of coins. 

All coins, as it happens are not the same. And I learned about it like this. 

One afternoon, as the heat of the summer dragged on, Boltac and I sat in the shade of the store with the windows open and the full door open. The only thing that moved in the air was the heat. And I confess, I eyed the scrolls of Frostbite more than once. 

When I had suggested that we might use one to cool the store and render our present situation more bearable, Boltac shook his head. "No, I don't like magic. No good ever comes of it."

"But I'm dying in this heat!" I protested. 

"Well go on and die already. Life is expensive enough as it is." And he went back to straightening the daggers that sat in a glass case.

Just then a shadow came across the late afternoon light coming through the door. I looked up and there was a woman in a fine dress. As she entered the store I could see that she wore expensive jewelry and cooled herself with a hand-painted fan from the East. 

"Then at least you'll be quiet," he countered. 


First among my duties was counting coins. It seemed that the entirely of my life was to be counting  


-- have him fail negotiating here and succeed negotiating at the end.

"Let's get you something to eat," said Boltac

With Boltac, the lessons never seemed to stop. A 

Rule #1 - 


----

The boy tries to negotiate for Boltac with the Wizard

-- Ah, you broke the rule -- never negotiate with someone who has nothing to lose. 






"Never sell yourself. And MOST of all, never sell yaself short."


----


Sequel -- Talking with a merchant.

Boltac -- You know, you remind me of me. And that's why I don't like you. 

What?

That's exactly what I would say. You want me to enforce your Writ of Sale so that no one else can have store in Robrecht. And you'd probably like me to to charge some kind of license fee for those wanted stalls in the market?

"Well, in your wisdom, you have said it my King, we must protect buyers from..." his words trailed off under Boltac's withering stare, "so that all will know that Robrecht is a safe and a fair... place to... do? business?"

"Enh-henh," said Boltac, "That won't protect buyers from the likes of you. All that will do is protect the likes of you from other sellers. The same rapacious wolves who are the only thing that can keep rapacious wolves like you at bay."

"Such disloyalty to the Merchant's Guild. I will report this. "





----

But I risked my life for this

And for that I am sorry, but the market says, it wasn't worth it.

But how is an honest adventurer supposed to make a living?

"An honest living? Is that what you want?" asked Boltac so sweetly, that I knew an explosion couldn't be far off.

"That's all any man asks. Especially as recompense for such selfless acts of heroism as keep this kingdom safe."

"Duchy," said Boltac.

"Nah, no matter who they are, they're all after my profits."

"You do not sound loyal to your King."

"Duke," said Boltac, "It's a Duchy. So it comes with a Duke. Perhaps I can get the boy here to hold up diagrams as we go along. And I'm not particular fond of the Duke, or any of the others. The man in charge around here changes so often it makes your head spin. But you know what never changes? The tax man."


-----
RATTICK

"But someone else risked their life for this."

You should be glad to see me. Glad of my custom in your store. Why I am one of your best customers. Without me you would have nothing to sell. 

Without you, Rattick, I feel that more people would be alive for me to sell things to.

"Don't be so hasty with your accusations. I am just a guide. I try to warn my charges, to provide good counsel for those who are adventure-minded, but, as we both know," Rattick said with something that sounded like sadness, "the world is a dangerous place."

"What a comfort that must be to their families," said Boltac. "That's my final offer."

"Some day Boltac, you are going to be in a position of weakness."

"If it evah happens, I can promise you, sweetheart, I won't be negotiating. Thank you. COME AGAIN!"




----

Wait, orphan. You aren't any kind of a chosen one? You don't have any mystical destiny I should know about? Are you spoken of in prophecy? 

"I don't think so. I don't think children who sleep in a pile of sticks against the lower wall are spoken of in prophecy"

You didn't float here in a bassinet made of reeds did you?

What's a bassinet. 

"Ah, yes. That's just what I like to hear. A bassinet is a special kind of basket in which you abandon babies."

"I wasn't abandoned as a baby. My parents were killed when I was five."

[[ Boltac tries the chosen one gambit -- tries to fake out the Wizard with the the boy -- of course, he is just a boy.]]

---

Oh my Lady, welcome to Boltac's

"It's a secret of the trade, treat the serving girl's like ladies and the ladies like serving girls. They LOVE that!"

I know a man in Brythria, has the finest daggers money can buy. 



---

# Marriage proposal. 

Boltac, I have debts. 

Now she tells me! You mean you don't have a dowry. No wait. Wait!" even though Asarah wasn't trying to say anything, "Its worse than that. You come with a negative dowry!"

---

"Prentice!" a voice boomed. "Why are you lazing about on the ground!" I struggled to see the source of the large voice, but could not escape the foot in my stomach. "I asked you a question!" the voice demanded. 

"I tripped," I said, barely able to get enough breath in my lungs to speak. 

"Alvasir, remove your foot from my boy, so he can tell me what he has done with my supper."

"Lunch?" asked the man with his foot in stomach. "You mean to tell me this sneak-thief is your apprentice?"

"Why of course he is. And a good boy too. Have you ever seen delivery boy so quick? I tell him to run and fetch my supper and you see how fast he moves."

"A thief, says I. A starveling not smart enough to run in a pack."

A pair of expensive boots, trimmed with fur, came into my limited view. "'Prentice, says I. Now move your foot." After moment, the pressure in my stomach eased. I sucked in air and rolled over clutching my side. 

When I looked, I was surprised to see that the owner of the voice was short, much shorter than it's booming register led me to believe.Boltac had the voice of a hero, but was squat and broad-chested. Perhaps 5'6". Alvasir, purveyor of unknown meat, glared down upon him. "He hasn't paid," he said, without outstretched palm.

Boltac grabbed my arm and lifted me to my feet. As soon as I was off the ground, my better instincts took over and I tried to wriggle free. But his grip was like a vise and I was held fast. 

"Prentice, pay the man," he said, pressing a coin into my hand. 

I looked down and saw a piece of gold, GOLD! In my palm. Gold was something that I had heard of, that I had heard clinking together in the depths of fat purses, that I had caught glimpse of like the flashes of fish in dark streams, but to actually hold a piece of it in my hand. This was more than enough to pay for the meat I had attempted to steal, and perhaps enough to pay for the man's whole food stand.

To this day, I don't know why I did what I did. Perhaps it was because I had never had much of anything before. Well, nothing except rags, a pain in my stomach and a nearly constant search for a place to sleep. But this was a gold coin. This was everything. 

"How much?" I asked.

"Give me the coin boy!" 

Having nothing to lose, I said, "A coin of gold for your fried rat?" The crowd of onlookers laughed. "Your price is too dear for me. My master would beat me for paying so much." 

"THIEF!" exploded Alvasir, "Give me the gold!" 

"As you see, I train my 'prentices well." He flung a few pennies on the ground and said, "Sorry for the trouble Alvasir." And he turned around and walked away. 

As soon as the crowd closed behind us, I tried to twist out of his grasp. I could remember nothing good ever happening to me, so why should I recognize a lucky break when it came my way? Boltac said nothing. He just left his vice like left hand clamped on my arm and made his way up the hill with his odd, limping gait. 

Exhausted, I asked, "Why did you save me?"

"I did not save you, boy. I made a purchase. I have need of a 'Prentice, and you seem a likely lad," he said with a laugh.  

"So I am an your slave." I asked, more than a little afraid. 

Boltac stopped. "Do you still have the gold coin lad?"

I nodded.

"Then let us make a deal," he said as he released my arm. "There. You are a free man, er, boy. Of some means. You may go." When I didn't run off, Boltac said, "There. Hungry, dirty you may be, but you're sure not stupid. Show that coin in the gutters lad and you'll lose it and your life in the blink of an eye. Come with me, work hard, and I will teach you a trade. Bastard boy will become a man, dealing equally with all and beholden to none."

I looked back down the hill. Thinking of the place below the market where I had been sleeping. It was little more than a pile of sticks and damp rags. And though I thought myself lord and master of my own hovel, the rats had other thoughts on the matter.

"Or, take the coin as gift of fate, and good luck to you, you prince of the streets."

It was no choice at all. I shook my head and offered the coin. 

"Enh," said Boltac as he took the coin. "That will do. What's your name, boy?"

"Relan."

"Ugh, what an awful name," he said, then turned and climbed the hill with his crab-wise, clumping right foot. Even though he was lamed I had trouble keeping up with him.

Those were fat days for the city of Robrecht.

Have to reveal his mangled leg. Like the man with the fucked up face.

Those were fat days in Robrecht, I can tell you that. Of the city and her politics, her ways are more twisted than the blackened pathways fo

Rattick tells him -- you have something of the thief about you -- mostly the eyes. Come with me and 'prentice' to a master thief

But there is something of the thief and the coward and the hero that dances in the eyes of all men. What we choose to practice makes the difference.

Trade caravan doesn't come through. B/C it's been wiped out by orcs. Terrible savage orcs.

"He's a bad man," the Chamberlain told, Boltac, "and no good will come of him." 

"No good will come of trifling with him," said Boltac, and made a motion as if he was to spit. 

We all knew he was a man with a past. What none of us realized was he was a man with a future. I had the nerve to ask him to borrow a sword. He hit me on the head

then he gave me the sword. He was like that. 

Endless hours

Let me slow down and tell you something of the place that I live. 

Now I am first Knight of Robrecht, granted the landholdings of the North. The most dangerous-- I am accounted a brave man by many deeds and more tales, but I will tell you. In all my days, I have never seen anything more brave than a fat shopkeeper with a limp, setting out to rescue the woman he loved.
