The Merchant Adventurer
=======================

This mess of files wants to be a book when it grows up. It is story inspired by a video game character. Specifically the merchant in the original Wizardry, Boltac. In the game he was an amazingly shrewd merchant, making it impossible for the players to turn a profit. 

This story is about a merchant who watches wave after wave of incompetent adventurers sally forth to raid a dungeon unsuccessfully. Until one day, a twist of fate forces him to try to defeat the evil wizard. 

This also an experiment with using github for ebook development. I call it gittenburg. The repo is here: https://github.com/PatrickEMcLean/gittenburg

output/fullbook.markdown is the latest draft (a mess, a damn mess, is what it is!)
