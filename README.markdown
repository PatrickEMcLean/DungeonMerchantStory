#The Merchant Adventurer (working title)

Instead of Powerful Barbarian vs. Evil Wizard, this is story Cunning Merchant vs. Evil Wizard. 

This is a story inspired by the merchant in the original Wizardry, Boltac. He was an amazingly shrewd merchant, making it impossible for the players to turn a profit.

If you like Terry Pratchett, Douglas Adams or P.G. Wodehouse, there is a chance you'll like my stuff. You can find out about all the books I've written and things I've made at [patrickemclean.com](http://www.patrickemclean.com)

## The Nuts and Bolts

Making a book from a story idea is gigantic, sloppy mess that doesn't fit into neat steps. Anyone who tells you that it does is selling something you don't want to buy. Perseverance and an almost pathological need to finish are the most important things.

But here are some other things that I use. 

* WorkingDraft.md is the continuous draft
* The files in Templates is a bunch of conceptual tools I find useful when thinking about the construction of stories. 
* The files in structure are various outlines and notes on my plan for the work. 
* output/fullbook.markdown is a collection of of all the md files in the main directory, allowing me to have a complete, tracked picture of the whole messy process of a book as it evolves. 
* filework.rb automates pushing writing/changes to git with an updated word count of what's in the draft( the draft being the only thing that really matters)

## Why the hell aren't you using Word, or Scrivner? 

This whole thing is an experiment with using github for ebook development. I call it gittenburg. There are few reasons I'm writing this way.

1. Markdown is awesome.
2. Tracking the evolution in github allows me to share the process as well as the final product. 
3. I'm working towards a faster, better way to produce ebooks
4. I'm working towards a faster, better, distributed way to do proofing (bugfixes for print)
5. I ain't no programmer. I is a writer. But I can still appreciate how cool github and open source tools are.
